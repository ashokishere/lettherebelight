## UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF THE SOUL

Love and greetings to all of you present here in person and to all those who are participating in this satsanga remotely online. Today's topic is "Understanding the Nature of the Soul.". It is the tenth in the series of discourses on the Bhagavad Gita as interpreted by GURUDEVA PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDAJI in his unique book 'God talks with ARJUNA.'. We are not here to understand the nature of the soul out of academic interest or for intellectual satisfaction. The understanding should give us and help us in dealing with the challenges we face in daily life.

## UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE OF THE SOUL

Love and greetings to all of you present here in person and to all those who are participating in this satsanga remotely online. Today's topic is "Understanding the Nature of the Soul.". It is the tenth in the series of discourses on the Bhagavad Gita as interpreted by GURUDEVA PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDAJI in his unique book 'God talks with ARJUNA.'. We are not here to understand the nature of the soul out of academic interest or for intellectual satisfaction. The understanding should give us and help us in dealing with the challenges we face in daily life, and in attaining the goal of life, that is perpetual joy. That is the purpose we want to understand in the nature of the soul; not out of curiosity or out of academic interest. With this in view let us study. Bhagavad Gita deals with this topic in the second chapter, Sankhya Yoga, particularly slokas 11 to 30. Last time we studied the first five of those, that is 11 to 15; we will resume our study from the 16th today. To pick up the thread of continuity let us briefly review what we studied last time. Most people in this world do not recognize the existence of the soul.
The Common Misunderstanding of the Soul

Common man takes care of his body, and his mind, and is totally oblivious of the soul at all. Someone prayed like this, "God, if there is a God; save my soul, if I have a soul.". For him the concept of soul is as mysterious as that of God. He has no clue although he's so close to that in day-to-day life.
We all have these bodies. I have this human body; I have a responsibility to take care of this body by right diet, right exercise. Isn't it true? When I do so the body in turn gives me health and mobility. But I also have a mind and I have to cultivate my mind by positive thinking and intellectual pursuits. When I do that mind in turn gives me intelligence, ability to get along with others. Many people stop there. But I also have a soul. I have to nourish my soul. The nourishment for the soul is meditation. When I nourish my soul properly in turn soul gives me intuition, creativity, perfect love, and unconditional joy. The unconditional joy, the ever new joy — nitya naveen ananda — comes from the soul, not from body or mind.

In other words, in addition to catering of the demands of the body and desires of the mind, we should also recognize the needs of the soul and fulfill them; demands of the body, desires of the mind, and also the needs of the soul. We have to fulfill. To put it in a simplified way — acknowledge, attune and attain. Acknowledge the existence of the soul, understand and attune to the nature of the soul, and attain the goal of life which is Satchitananda. Acknowledge, attune and attain.

## Review of Previous Slokas (11-15)

Now briefly the meaning of slokas 11 to 15: "Those who always weep and complain that the life is filled with bitter things reveal the narrowness of their minds." GURUJI says so. like children they keep complaining. Parents know that it it the trivial things they're worried about — you know these complaints. Similarly those who are complaining that life is full of bitter things and unfair events they are also really complaining trivial things, because these are all about body and mind — what we are complaining about. But we are really the souls.

When we attune ourselves with that soul these won't appear to be anymore complaints — just experiences, passing experiences. It's like this. If you go to ocean you can complain that the ocean is very restless, waves coming and going, no? Very restless. But if you want to see the experience of the real ocean you have to go into the ocean. Then you see vast stillness. That is the real sea, real ocean; not just the waves.

Another point that we understood last time is, when one dies there is no annihilation to the soul. It only changes the body incarnation after incarnation. That we should realize. There is no annihilation to the soul. We should understand and affirm that, "I am not this body. I am the soul — the tenant inside. I am the tenant not the house.".

Then heat and cold, pain and pleasure, are produced by the senses when they come in contact their objects. Bear them with equanimity. That's the advice. Because they in the realm of our senses — heat and cold, pleasure and pain. But you are not the senses; you are the soul inside. So bear them with patience, endurance. It's possible.

The example is this: When a city boy gets hurt in a game in the school, he may make a big fuss out of it — doctors, this-that, etc. Whereas a village boy with the same injury in a sport may not even recognize it. He just bears it. The same injury — endurance, endurance.

And another example that we studied last time was that of anvil. Nihai — anvil. Anvil is used by blacksmith. On that he changes the shape of small iron pieces. For instance if an iron rod is round in crosssection, that he can take and hammer it to make it flat and then bend it all the time using the anvil. But anvil is giving support, anvil is not changing. Only the piece of iron that is changing the shape; not the anvil. Similarly the soul is like an anvil, it is not changing. The body is changing, mind is changing. So be like the anvil which watches what's happening to this body and to the mind. You are that anvil. You are that soul on which it is happening. That is why people like GANDHIJI, GURUJI'S father — they could allow surgeons to do surgery on their body without anesthesia because they could identify themselves with the soul, which is supporting this body. They could withdraw their consciousness from this body. It's possible, because we are really souls. Souls. That's what we studied last time.

## Slokas 16 and 17: Reality vs. Illusion

Now we'll take up sloka 16 and 17 together. I request SW. VASUDEVANANDAJI to sing:
The plain meaning given by GURUJI in 'God talks to ARJUNA' goes like this: "Of the unreal, there is no existence. Of the real, there is no nonexistence. The final truth of both of these is known by men of wisdom. Know as imperishable the One by whom everything has been manifested and pervaded. No one has power to bring about the annihilation of this Unchangeable Spirit.".

Sounds too philosophical, but GURUJI has given a very simplified explanation which we can understand easily. You know "The senses say that a flower that was never born has shed no fragrance;" it's simple logic. There's no flower, there's no fragrance. That's our understanding. But the garden rose, by its fragrance declares its existence. Similarly a star in the sky proclaims its presence by its radiance. But men of wisdom, they say that even this garden rose and this star in the sky are also not real, because a garden rose fades away at some point. Afterwards where is its fragrance; where is its existence?. Similarly many a star disappeared with time. So there what is real, is the essence behind this. The essence behind this rose, the essence which has made the star — they are real. That essence we are interested in; not in these passing ones. I mean that we have to understand thoroughly. But they're all real for us you know — garden rose and these are all real. Whatever we see they are real.

## The Dream Analogy

I would like to share with you one experience I had. That time I was in Ranchi; my office was fronting a lawn — just a small office. Just in front a few steps and then an office. One day after my morning meditation and breakfast I went to my office. I just started my regular work, opened my computer; I was working. Then there was a telephone call. My mobile rang, I answered. It is from one of our devotees who was placed very high in the government office. So he gave me a good news, "Swamiji our application has been approved. Now we can start the project.". We had applied for some approvals, government was taking time and he helped us with that. Eventually it was approved. When he gave that news I was so happy. "So long we have been waiting, now it's cleared.". I could really see that happiness I was enjoying. The project now we can start. In that happiness, enjoying, I just leaned back like that. Chair has four legs, first two legs came up this way and the back was very close to the wall.

Just enjoying, I was balanced — enjoying. After maybe a minute or two, I just opened my eyes and saw a snake was there; very close, and the snake was crawling and was just climbing the wall. It just was going and very close to me. Very close. And I wanted to come forward, but it was not stable, you know. So I could not immediately come down and run away, because I was there in the air like this. and it was climbing. My heart started pumping, sweating, all the joy of good news is gone instantly — all that. Now only heart pumping.

I could see that and already sweating; sweating started. I don't know it was just coming, coming, very, very — I can't imagine that. That time then I woke up. Do you understand what happened? All this was a dream. It didn't really happen. It was all a dream, you know. That good news, and happiness, and then the snake, and fear, and sweating, and all that was —. Now if I continue with my dream what you would say? Big deal, what is there. Anything can happen, that's not real. Why are you worried about it? You are no more interested if I say anything further.

Until now you were very interested — "What happened what happened?". But now once you say it's a dream, you are not interested. But it was real to me. So much so. It may be a dream, there's no reality in that; but why is that sweating?. Even after I woke up, my heart was still pumping hard. I could see that because it was real. Not only mentally, physiologically it was real that's why heart was responding, that means sweating was there. The trace of that effect was so much that — that was night time it happened. next day morning when I went to the office, first I looked and then — I mean it was so real in a way. it was real, you know. It happened.

Now the same thing, all the experiences we are going through, they are real — the emotions we go through; the victories, the failures we have in life. The relationships we have. These are all true; But they are true, real as long as we are in this cosmic delusion. Once we wake up from this dream then it's gone. Eventually after I woke up, it's gone. All that snake, everything is gone out of my mind.
Similarly all these experience will go. who is dreaming this cosmic dream? Who is dreaming? God? Who is God? My higher Self — it's me that's dreaming especially. I am in this cosmic dream and I am going to wake up one day. That means I'm going to identify myself more with that soul than with this body and mind. Generally I'm identified, you know. Attuned, with my body and mind. That's why all these are so real to me. So attune yourself with your soul. Then you are different. I mean that is the idea. Until then it's all real; what all we are going through, everything is real in this world, until we wake up and we are going to wake up. We are going to wake up. That is why we want to understand what is the nature of the soul, and how we can attune with that so that we wake up from this dream.

## Slokas 18 and 19: The Inner Battle

Next let us take up the next two slokas 18 and 19. GURUJI'S translation: "Regarded as having a termination of existence are these fleshly garments; immutable, imperishable, and limitless is the indwelling Self. With this wisdom, O Descendent of BHARATA, battle thou! He who considers the Self as the slayer; he who deems that it can be slain: neither of these knows the truth. The Self doesn't kill, nor it is killed.".
Now here, 'God Talks with ARJUNA,' clearly explains that the devotee should be aware of the inner battle that's taking place between good and evil tendencies within. As a result, as a devotee I'm more concerned about the Kurukshetra inside me, rather than that Kurukshetra which took place 3,000 years ago out there in Haryana. Here it is between the tendencies of the senses and the true nature of the soul — that Kurukshetra. GURUJI'S interpretation: "KRISHNA therefore tells ARJUNA: Concentrate on your Inner Self, the image of the Eternal Spirit, which, like It, is immortal. Fear not to fight the senses and to destroy the attachment to the body! This, sooner or later, you will be compelled to do!".

Fighting the senses means what? We don't fight with our ears and eyes. We are fighting with the tendencies, the desires of the senses that are trying to get control. We are going to gain self-control, that is what is meant by fighting the senses. Fear not, you are not really making the senses ineffective. You are only conquering the tendencies of the senses. Senses will be there to serve you in good actions. So fear not to fight the senses because you will have to do it anyway. Rather you will be compelled to do it. How long you would like to go on eating whatever you want. You know we have to eat whatever we need, whatever is appropriate. I can't go on eating whatever I want, whatever I want. I will be compelled at some point. If not now as we are aging at some point I will be compelled to give up this which I have been enjoying earlier. So we will be compelled to fight the senses. So why not now, so that we gain control over this body and mind, and we become attuned to the soul.

## The Eternal Soul and the Dead Body

And next other thing is eventually only the body dies not the soul. Body is killed, not the soul. And who kills? Here ARJUNA is worried that he had to kill his own friends and relatives. That was his predicament. "I have to kill.". Then BHAGAVAN KRISHNA says who is killing?. His soul cannot be killed, you are killing the person who wronged. Who wronged. I mean that physical body not the soul. Soul is eternal. Neither soul can be killed nor soul can kill another one. That is the idea. GURUJI gives this explanation that, like in a Motion Picture villain is there; the villain kills someone. That's only for three hours or two hours. Afterwards villain is there the person who killed was there. Everyone is there?. It's only the lights and shadows gave that impression that someone killed someone else. Similarly here it's only one body maybe destroying the other one; but the soul is intact.

But GURUJI also wants that this deep philosophy should not be misused. and say that, "Let's destroy our enemies; he troubled me, let me destroy him. Because I'm not going to do anything. It's only the soul. I'm soul but this body if it is destroyed, how does it matter? You know, because soul can neither be destroyed, nor it can destroy. So I can destroy or harm my enemies.". No, that's not true. That's not correct. Because such philosophy — "I can destroy my enemies, because I'm not affecting their souls," that doesn't impress God nor police. You know in a courtroom once, one murderer, he was being tried. He said, "My Lord, I didn't kill. This knife killed.". And the judge said, "I will not punish you; this pen is punishing you.". So you get the same thing, because if you do all these things this yama-niyama principles are required in living this deep philosophy should not be misused, misunderstood, to do whatever we want to do. It's not only killing others, even misusing, overeating or over-watching TV all these things have to be controlled. We can't say that we are not responsible.

Ultimate burden is on the soul. You know because it is incarnating, reincarnating. For example, it doesn't go with one lifetime any troubles we have made. One person was traveling by train and as per rules for the class he was traveling, 35 kilos of luggage is allowed. Anything beyond that he has to pay extra. But he had 45 kilos. What he did is, he made it into two — one is 35 kilos, other is 10 kilos. The 35 kilos of baggage he kept there next to his seat, and 10 kilos he carried on his head thinking that I'm carrying. When ticket collector comes he says that, "I'm carrying only 35, this 10 I'm carrying.". But eventually it is the burden on the train. Train is carrying. Similarly we may do something. "My soul is eternal it can't harm others, etc. I can harm others.". No! You are eventually the soul attached to this body. that is that has done this one. Those results cannot be escaped. It's burden is ultimately on the soul because next incarnation it has to pay whatever we do. So the 10 Kilos also we have to pay and he was charged.

## Sloka 20: Eternal Nature and Identity

Next 20th sloka, SWAMIJI. The English translation of this Sanskrit sloka as given by GURUJI: "This Self is never born nor does it ever perish; nor having come into existence will it again cease to be. It is birthless, eternal, changeless, ever-same. It is not slain when the body is killed.". Here there are two points — one is the eternal nature of the soul; at the same time the changes that take place in the body in which the soul is residing. The two points are mentioned here:
Eternal nature means once we have existence as souls, that individuality is maintained always. It's always there even after getting merged in Divinity. Still that is there. That identity is there. See now, oftentimes we say that the individual soul is like a wave and God is ocean. Waves come and merge in the ocean. So when wave comes it dances as if it has independent existence; after some time later it goes back into the sea. Another wave comes. Will you ever say that the same wave came again? No. That wave lost its identity. Some other wave comes, not the same wave, depending on the wind pattern. So it lost it's identity. But it's not that way. We may be waves, God is ocean but even after the wave merges in the ocean. I may merge in God but still I maintain the identity. That's why we say that such and such a saint is born, reincarnated. When a saint achieved God he merged with God. You know, God-realization was there and he merged with God. But we still don't say, "God reincarnated.". But we say that saint reincarnated. That means that identity is maintained. That is not only for saints, for you and me also. Identity is maintained. Say in this incarnation you are PRATAP, I am SMARANANANDA. Not only in this incarnation, even after much later also we would know that we are this. We are like this, maybe if our memory is strong enough, one day we meet again and recall this, "On that day in Noida you were here and I was here.". Maybe we will recall. The identity is maintained — identity. That's one thing which meant having come into existence, it will again never cease to come into existence. Soul will never cease to be. It always has that identity.

At the same time the body, as part of matter is spoken of as undergoing the following six transformations of impermanent nature. Transformations are there, they are also of impermanent nature. What are these things? Birth, existence, development, change, decay and annihilation — death. These are all for the body.
Let me read this long passage of GURUJI'S, very, very pertinent. He says the "The deep truths of the Gita should not be looked upon as metaphysical abstractions, but should be applied in daily life. Particularly during these times when cosmic delusion presents sickness, physical torture, the experience of ordinary death, and morbid thoughts of the impermanency of the body, one should strongly counteract these negative suggestions by remembering the truth that the Self is reflected Spirit-Immortality, ever itself and free from the whims of change.".

Because in sickness, — this is a practical utility the concept — In sickness we feel, "What is this, what is this?". Then we should understand that, "I am not this body which is going through sickness. I'm temporarily encased here. I'm temporarily residing here. It's going through, let me see what I can do to repair this house, to get rid of this disease while going through this with an even mind.". That should be the thought because, "I'm not this; I'm not this.". That's why we should understand it appropriately.
There's a beautiful Cosmic chant given by GURUJI, "O life is sweet and death a dream; O health is sweet, sickness a dream.". Health is there, it's so sweet, I enjoy. When there is sickness it's a dream, the dream passes away. We know that even in a dream we are experiencing the emotions, but it passes away dream. Like that this sickness also will pass away like a dream. That we have to use that, so that we are not severely affected by that sickness or any trouble we are going through. Use this concept, "I am that soul which is eternal. Not this, not this. I'm the anvil. I'm seeing only this and peace which is going through changes.". That concept should be there. That concept.

GURUJI continues: "Thus does the Gita emphasize the following qualities of the Self:" — means the soul. "It is unborn, though in a body; the soul is unborn though it is in a body; it is changeless, though it's bodily dwelling is impermanent; it is ever the same, though in the long pathway of incarnation which ultimately leads to God, the soul appears in countless forms; the soul is not slain when the body dies; and when the soul returns to Spirit, it doesn't lose its identity, but will exist unto everlastingness.".
A beautiful description of what you are and what I am. I mean that's what we should understand more and more and live by live by, remember you have to recollect this, the qualities of the soul which we are.

## Slokas 21 and 22: Changing Garments and Self-Control

Next we'll take up two slokas together, 21 and 22. The English translation given by GURUJI: "How can he who knows the Self to be imperishable, everlastingly permanent, birthless and changeless, possibly think that this Self can cause the destruction of another. O PARTHA, whom does it slay?". "Just as an individual forsaking dilapidated raiment dons new clothes, so the body-encased soul, relinquishing decayed bodily habitations, enters others that are new.". This is easy to understand.

Again senses, regarding senses GURUJI says, "This sloka conveys also a deep metaphysical lesson. The soul, KRISHNA says to the ego, ARJUNA: 'O my lower self, you must lift yourself to my plane of higher consciousness. Even if you destroy the wicked attachments of the senses, you are foolish to think that the senses themselves will be destroyed! Your higher Self only purifies the lower self; it doesn't destroy it.".
We don't destroy the senses because in this Kurukshetra that's going on within we are definitely fighting the Kauravas which are representatives of senses. We are fighting the senses means only the inclinations of the senses. For example, tongue. It is not that we annihilate the tongue and its perceptions. It's a question of how much to eat and what to eat. That's the question — what to eat and how much to eat. Similarly watching TV is not prohibited. Eyes are there to help us to enjoy TV, but what to watch and how much to watch. I mean that's a question. That is what is the advice here. We have to lift ourselves to higher consciousness from lower consciousness. We are purifying the lower consciousness. Not that we are annihilating the senses. We are purifying the senses. In other words we are gaining self-control and once there is self-control, be it with eating or listening or watching or touching whatever it is, whenever there is self-control we really enjoy the resultant freedom from habits; resultant freedom, you know, from going down the hill. There is so much freedom when there is self-control. If you don't do this, which should not be done, there is a lot of freedom, inner joy. That is the advice given here.

GURUJI also says, "On the other hand if he transmutes his physical greed for food into greed for continuous communion with God, he doesn't destroy his excessive appetite but changes it from an evil agent to a medium for good.". Desire for food should be transmuted into desire for God.

And the next part is, in life one after another, so many dresses we wear; and we use a dress with a lot of interest, no? and after some time we lose interest in that. It's old and at some point we get a new one and completely discard this. We're happy actually. You know, we do that — discard the old garment with a sense of joy only, joy, we leave it. Similarly death should be considered that way. Death is not for me, death is not for my soul. Death is for the body in which I am tenanted, I'm living. So when I'm losing this to death, I'm going to get something better. That consciousness we should develop because I'm the soul which is going to get another house, which is going to get another house, another garment I'm going to get. Always anything new is going to be interesting.

Not only that we have to understand that death is a promotion, spiritual promotion to get another opportunity in a better environment for our onward progress spiritually. It's always a promotion, always. It's a transformation rather than annihilation. It is an upward evolution rather than blotting away of our existence. Death doesn't blot away our existence. It's only onward. Also look at death like this, because we always have that fear. You know ultimately what happens we are continuously progressing spiritually, continuously we are progressing. And all that is accumulated here now, spiritual progress will help us to be in a better environment. So next time I will be in a place where I'm little closer to God, dearer to 

GURUJI. I'm progressing, so that is a place, a better palace than what I am living in now.
One more thing. GURUJI said that when you cross the threshold to enter another life, then one of the gurus will usher you. One of the gurus. So death can be viewed as a beautiful decorated arch where the transition is made. I am in this place and there's a beautiful arch which is leading to a better place, a better palace where I'm going to live. Spiritually it is much more advanced and not only that, I'm also not alone. As I'm crossing this I'm being ushered by one of my gurus. Have that understanding, that we are not left alone and we are going to a better place. So who doesn't like new clothes?. So we should also look for that new clothes we are going to don. It's not, it's not sadness that should dominate but that doesn't mean that we invite death. We don't invite death, but we're not afraid of it, that's it.

## The Role of Meditation

And to understand this, one has to meditate regularly because only in meditation, especially the stillness born of meditation, there we glimpse the nature of the soul. Because in stillness what? In stillness we don't feel the weight of this body. "I'm so light, I'm so light there. There I am beyond my likes and dislikes.". It is just, just pure consciousness. Just joy, just joy. If you're meditating more and more, spend more and more time in stillness we get used to that, that ever new joy. We get used to that glimpse of the final ultimate Bliss that we are really. So we get used to that then there will be something to look forward to. "I'm going there.". So meditation helps us, trains us, to be prepared for the transition. So let's meditate, meditate; make use of all the conditions we have. Make use of it. Meditate more and more, longer and longer, deeper and deeper; then we'll understand, "Yes there is a joy, I am that joy, I am that joy.". That means I am with the soul, I'm identifying myself with the soul, which is joy.
Just one analogy — just prod yourself to spend more time in spiritual pursuits. One king invited some of his noble officers and those kings which are under him. And a party was going on, a function and in that the king gave very valuable expensive robes to each one of them — the guests. Very expensive clothes he gave. The function was going on. Then one of the officers in the kingdom, he had cough and sneezing. Then what he did is, he took this gift he received from the King — that robe — and wiped his nose. I mean, just like that he did it. The KING saw it and he was annoyed. Then he addressed the Minister sitting next to him and said, "See, he has insulted me. I gave him such a valuable expensive gift and he is using it to wipe his nose.". He was annoyed, insulted. Then the Minister said, "I wonder RAJAN, what God is thinking about us.".

God gave us this expensive valuable gift of body. Human body is very precious. It has a spine with chakras, sahasrara it has. And we can meditate. Human body you know. A bird cannot meditate. You know, a cow cannot meditate; we can meditate. Make use of chakras, invoke them. Go to higher realms of consciousness. But are we making use of the valuable gift God has given us?. But what God is thinking?. No doubt I'm making use of this body; what am I making use — tongue. Regularly I use it without fail; I use my eyes, ears, skin, all this. I use my senses, but I don't use so much my chakas. Isn't it a good analogy? God is annoyed?. I'm sorry here KING was annoyed. He felt insulted. Only difference is God is not annoyed and he doesn't feel insulted. He has infinite patience, that's all. But it's for us otherwise we will be insulting ourself actually. We will be depriving ourselves of the benefits of this human body, benefits of the chakras, the consciousness. How do we make use of this body? How do we take advantage of the chakras? Meditation, yoga meditation. That's why we have to meditate more and more. Then we'll be pleasing not only ourselves, we'll be pleasing GURUJI and God also. Because we're going to make use of this beautiful valuable gift.

## Slokas 23 and 24: Unchangeable Spirit

Next let's go to slokas 23 and 24. The English translation given by GURUDEVA: "No weapon can pierce the soul; no fire can burn it; no water can moisten it; nor can any wind wither it. The soul is uncleavable; it cannot be burnt or wetted or dried. The soul is immutable, all-permeating, ever calm, and immovable — eternally the same.".

More or less the same description, eternal nature of the soul. Let me read out GURUJI'S explanation. "No matter how devastating, the dreamer is never hurt by the happenings in his dream; he finds himself safe after the dream is over.". Because that snake didn't harm me at all. How devastating, how painful it was. It was no, for some time?. But it didn't harm me. Similarly whatever we are going through — all these experiences — they maybe very painful but eventually they are not going to touch our souls when we wake up.
Let's wake up as soon as possible. That's the message and one more interesting point GURUJI gives here. His words: "No matter how much one has been meditating, if he still becomes overwhelmed with bodily suffering or is afraid of disease or death, he has advanced little and has realized little. The aspirant must meditate deeper and deeper until he can attain ecstatic communion with God and thus forget the limitations of the body.". We have to meditate. Meditation is not just a habit, little bit you know, meditate; Just spend some 15 minutes, 20 minutes, half an hour. Meditate deeper and longer regularly so we get used to that ecstatic communion. We get used to that ever new joy. That may not stay with us throughout 24 hours, but at least those periods let's get used to it, have a taste of it.

"During meditation," GURUJI says, "he must not only think, but realize, that he is formless, omnipresent, omniscient, far above all body changes!". This is what exactly meditation can do to us. When we meditate, you don't feel this body is 60 kilos. You feel that weightlessness; you are not this body, you are almost like you are a witness to this body. You know, witness to this body, and that consciousness that you are not this body will start dawning on us that will come bit by bit, bit by bit. When that comes, then we know that this soul cannot be moistened by water, it cannot be burnt by fire; all those things become a reality to us by our own experience. Again whatever we do, whatever we read, whatever we listen, it all comes back to one point — meditate.

There is no substitute for meditation. You know we cannot go on talking about meditation. We have to be doing it. You remember that analogy which we studied sometime back? In business there is a silent partner, — sleeping partner, silent partner they call — because he has financial interest but he's not involved in day-to-day affairs, he is a silent partner. In tennis we have a non-playing Captain. He goes with the team, he doesn't play but he is sort of Captain, non-playing Captain. I mean that is all right, silent partner is okay in business, in tennis non-playing Captain is okay; but did you ever hear about a non-practicing yogi?. Do you want to be one?. You are a student of YSS/SRF, you are a disciple of PARAMAHANSA YOGANANDAJI, you admire him, you follow him, just that you don't meditate long enough. That is non- practicing yogi. It doesn't work. If you want to be a yogi you have to be practicing. There is only practice, practice, practice meditation. That's what, whatever we say comes to that eventually — meditate.
 
 ## Slokas 25, 26, and 27: The Unavoidable Cycle

Next three slokas, 25, 26 and 27. The plain translation given by GURUDEVA: "The soul is said to be imponderable, unmanifested, and unchangeable. Therefore, knowing it to be such, thou shouldst not lament. "But if thou dost imagine the soul incessantly to be born and to die, even in that case, O ARJUNA, thou shouldst not grieve for it. For that which is born must die, and that which is dead must be born again. Why then shouldst thou grieve about the unavoidable?".

GURUJI'S explanation: "God sent man to earth to be entertained by the bodily dreams, not to obscure his consciousness of immortality by being identified with the body. It is therefore foolish for one to grieve about the bodily changes of which the soul, the Self, is the changeless witness.".

Very simple. We are here in this creation, in this world to see this world as an entertainment. When we watch something and when a movie is going on it's entertainment, no?. Whatever emotions we have they are temporary; we are just going through. But here the difference is this: here in this cosmic drama we are actors as well as audience. If you're only audience that's different. But we also actors, don't forget that. We are also actors. So to really be audience we have to identify ourselves with the soul. Then we can watch this without much involvement. Otherwise we are just part of that entertainment, giving entertainment to others and we are going through the emotions. So we have to have that consciousness above these. Bodies and mind, they are playing a role. Soul has to be above this to be able to enjoy. Essentially we are both actors and audience at the same time.

To play our roles better we have to have that guidance, inner guidance, inner guidance. Follow the moral principles, yama-niyama. Also express and experience the divine love in daily life. Again express and experience that unconditional joy. Love and joy are the qualities of the soul. They are nature of God. So that is the training we have to receive and we have to express in daily life that love and joy and wisdom.

## The Basis of Decisions

Now meditation definitely helps us. See in daily life we have to take many decisions. Some are major, some are minor. Daily life we have to take decisions. How do we take decisions? Generally our decisions are based on our likes, dislikes and past experiences. You know I want to do this because I like to do it. I like it so I will do this. I don't want to do it because I don't like it. Decisions are quite often based on likes and dislikes and past experiences. But anything, any decision that's solely based on likes and dislikes may not be the right one. They are not the right ones. Similarly past experience may not be the right experience we had to decide what to do in future.

So the decision should be based on forethought. We should be able to see what could happen, even if we don't know exactly what could happen — intuition. That should be the basis of decisions, then it would be right intuition. And we are all equipped with that faculty of intuition — "Sixth Sense.". We all have that. We all have that intuition but it's dormant. Intuition manifests in the calmness, stillness born of deep meditation. When we are still and you can actually examine yourself. When you are still after meditation you are free from likes and dislikes. I myself can vouch for that.

Sometimes I think this way and this is what is going to happen are very clear about events. "I like this, I don't like this," things are there. Maybe I'm likely to do this. Then I go for meditation. After meditation after Kriya etc. after stillness is there, and just think about it, what I thought was completely different from what I have now. In my mind it is completely different. Oh no, how does it matter?. It's completely different because temporarily I'm there being guided by intuition. God's guidance is there. That is why to play our roles well we have to keep meditating. We have to. We we are both audience as well as actors. To play well we have to keep meditating. There we get guidance from inside. Again meditation is the key to understand the nature of the soul and to play our roles.

## Slokas 28, 29, and 30: Manifestation and Perception of the Soul

Next, last three slokas 28, 29 and 30. VASUDEVA. The meaning: "The beginning of all creatures is veiled, the middle is manifested, and the end again is imperceptible, O BHARATA. Why, then, lament this truth?". "Some behold the soul in amazement. Similarly, others describe it as marvelous. Still others listen about the soul as wondrous. And there are others who, even after hearing all about the soul, do not comprehend it at all. O BHARATA, the One who dwells in the bodies of all is eternally inviolable. Grieve not, therefore, for any created being.".

Through history, biology, and other sciences, man learns about manifested things. For example I can understand what's happening between my birth and my death. I can understand it using whatever means; but I can't understand what was before my birth and what's going to be beyond my death. Only this is the manifested period. This one. Then if it's limited only for this one little bit why are you worried so much about it; not an eternal thing. history can give only this much information. Science can give only this much information, not before and not beyond that. That only soul can give. What was and what will be and what is. All that only soul can give.

And one more point GURUJI said beautifully. Let's mark his words. He said, "Knowledge of the complete history of the series of incarnations of every man on earth and in heaven would not be worth the temporary loss of the blissful God-contact!". What does it mean?. You may gather the knowledge about the information about all my incarnations previous. Not only that, I may know everything about all people and those who are in heaven. All this knowledge may be there. But that's not worth at the cost of losing God-contact even for a little while. This knowledge is not as useful as the experience we have. Experience of that ever new joy — Satchitananda, is much more, much more than the knowledge. Knowledge is not important; that experience of divinity within that is more important. That's the message here. That's beautifully put here. So people who would like to gather more information, more information, more, more knowledge, more knowledge. That's not going to fulfill the deepest needs of the soul. That's not going to take us much closer to God. But this experience born of meditation — that we don't want to lose even momentarily.
And in the next sloka that is 29th GURUJI explains how the divinity is perceived. How God is experienced.

GURUJI'S words: "The three modes of perceiving the soul mentioned in this sloka — beholding, describing or speaking of, and listening about — imply three of the manifestations by which the soul reveals itself:". Soul reveals in three ways: One — beholding the Light, as light God manifests you know the soul. Next — Wisdom. That means, describing its wonder — Wisdom. Third — Cosmic Sound. Hearing; communion with the bliss-imparting Cosmic Sound of Aum. These are the three ways one can see light and experience the soul. One can get that knowledge, description of soul. Other one, can see soul as Cosmic Sound. These are the three ways God manifests Himself. One can contact that soul in one of the three ways.

GURUJI continues, "Spirit and soul manifest as Light, Wisdom and Sound. When yogis develop deep intuition, they may experience the soul as an amazing mystical Light. When devotees feel the soul as a ray of Cosmic Intelligence, they speak of it in terms of marvelous Wisdom. Other persons perceive the soul as an exquisite audible vibration of the wondrous Cosmic Sound, or blissful Aum.". These are the three ways: Light, Sound or Wisdom.

But one thing, you know, we have techniques our Aum Technique to contact God in one of His aspects that is sound vibration. And we see light while meditating, or while practicing Jyoti Mudra we see light; that's manifestation of God. But one thing, whatever lights you see if it doesn't come with a sense of deep, deep joy it's not of much use. It's not the Light we want to see. We want to experience Divinity in that process, isn't it so?. Is that Light we want to see? Or you want to have the experience of divinity?. The experience of divinity means that must come with a sense of fulfillment; with a sense of joy. That's important.

You know if there is Light, you see light in meditation or Jyoti Mudra, whenever, and people sometimes say that this is yellow, this is golden yellow; last time it was lemon yellow. What is this, is it light blue, deep blue, sky blue?. If you keep thinking about this means we are far from that. We are seeing no doubt colors, not Divine Light. Anything Divine Light is that GURUJI said in the previous sloka, the knowledge of entire, all incarnations of yourself and others. That's not of much use compared to that Bliss you feel. Similarly this light, just seeing the light it should come with an experience associated with that. I mean that is Divinity. That is soul. Nature of the soul — that joy comes. No doubt it is. We don't always see this light. That light can be seen with closed eyes. God is behind the darkness of our closed eyes. So it's really interesting definitely. But that should come not for ego satisfaction that I saw light yellow light, blue light. It is with that experience of that Divinity. Similarly Aum, what is Aum? Cosmic sound?. All sound, there is no sound which is not Aum. Get merged in that, that experience should be there, experience experience — not sound, not light — mere outward. I mean that's what.

## The Yogi's Equilibrium

And last sloka, This is again GURUJI'S words: "The yogi, the man of perfect equilibrium, is neither hypersensitive nor stoically heartless.". See he is not hypersensitive in the sense, when body goes through problems, we have problems in life, he is not hypersensitive that everything is lost. I am so this, I'm like this; what is this?. Complaints, weeping he's not that. He's not hypersensitive. Problems are there, he bears them with an even mind. He bears them, equilibrium is there; at the same time he is not heartless. If someone else is suffering either because of disease or because of bereavement or something else, he's not heartless to say, "You are the soul, don't worry. Nothing happened.". He won't say that. Something really happened, "No, I am with you and let's go through this together.". It takes time to understand that he's not heartless, no?. That's what is a real yogi — neither hypersensitive nor stoically heartless. No. He's not sensitive to his own problems, at the same time he is compassionate for others who are going through. Let's not overwhelming others. That is real nature.
So this is the true nature of the soul. Let's remember we would like to understand the nature of the soul not out of academic interest or intellectual satisfaction. I understand soul is this, soul is that — it cannot be burned, it cannot be moistened etc. not that way. How it's going to be useful for me, especially in times of difficulties I mean that is important, the knowledge of soul should help us in facing the challenges in our daily life. Knowledge of the soul should help us to go deeper in meditation, to attain our final goal that is Satchitananda — ever new bliss. I mean that is the purpose. So acknowledge, attune, and attain. Acknowledge the existence of the soul; Attune to the nature of the soul; and attain the goal of life. That is the message of Gita. In addition to catering to the demands of the body and desires of the mind let us also fulfill the needs of the soul.

Jai Guru!.
