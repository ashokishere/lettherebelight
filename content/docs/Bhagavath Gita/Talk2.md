### Introduction and Context Review

Greetings! Loving pranams to all of you. I’m so happy to be with you all once again to resume our study of the Bhagavad Gita as interpreted by Paramahansa Yoganandaji in his book, "God Talks With Arjuna.". In the first discourse we had, we could cover only the first sloka of the first chapter. Before we go to the second sloka, I would like to briefly review what we discussed last time in order to pick up the thread of continuity. To understand Bhagavad Gita, we have to understand the context of the Gita.

Pandavas lost their kingdom in the game of dice. Consequently, they had to go into exile—twelve years of aranyavas in forest, followed by one year of agnyaatavas. One year they had to spend in disguise. And they did that. Thirteen years they spent and they came back and demanded their kingdom, which belonged to them morally and legally. But Kauruvas denied them. Having no other option, Pandavas declared a war to reclaim their own rightful kingdom. On the eve of the war – Kurukshetra, Arjuna goes despondent after seeing the people he had to fight. His own people he had to fight. At that time, Bhagavan Krishna gives this advice — Gita.

## The Metaphysical Analogy: The Kurukshetra Within

There is an analogy here with my own life and with your own life. because “Aham Brahmasmi” — I am divine. I’m a spark of divinity as you are, he and she, everyone. We are all different expressions of the same divinity, but that divine kingdom within me I lost in the game of delusion. As Pandavas lost in the game of dice, I lost my divine kingdom in the game of delusion. Having lost my divinity, I’m living in exile as a mere mortal, moving around, forgetting about my divine heritage.

For Pandavas, it was only thirteen years of exile. But for me, not just thirteen years, not just thirteen incarnations — many, many, many, many incarnations I am in exile living like a mere mortal. After having many, many hard knocks life after life, I realized that my kingdom is not this. This world is full of challenges — “samsara dukkha sagara” – so that blissful kingdom is within. I want that, which I lost. Pandavas mere asking for the kingdom did not work because Kauravas sitting here denied.

Similarly, my mere asking, my own divinity, is not adequate. because there are Kauruvas sitting in me who are denying me my kingdom. Who are these Kauruvas? Ahamkara — ego, desires, pride, jealousy, habits, greed, attachments. These are all various characteristics I have – negative characteristics. As long as they are there, I cannot get back my kingdom. And they are there – Kauruvas.

In the book, "God Talks With Arjuna," Guruji explains, Duryodhana represents the King Material Desire in me. Duhshasana, his brother, represents anger. Karna represents attachment and greed. Bhishma represents ego, Dronacharya — habit, Shalya — pride. These are all Kauruvas sitting in me.

I have a bit of all these things — negative qualities; but I also have some Pandavas. Self-control – Arjuna. I have some degree of self-control. Arjuna is in me. Pranayama – Bhima, Yama-Niyama I follow. Nakula Sahadeva – they are here. Like that I have some Pandavas, too. So, it’s a war between my good tendencies and evil tendencies.
As Arjuna was upset when he saw the people he had to fight, he said that it is not worth fighting my own people, not worth — I don’t need this material kingdom. I don’t want to fight!. Then Bhagavan Krishna advises that those whom you think that they're your well-wishers, they are not truly your well-wishers. They are denying you, your rightful kingdom. Similarly, for me, to get back my Divinity I have to get rid of all these negative tendencies. But when I see the tendencies I have to relinquish I get alarmed. because I enjoy being lazy. I take pride in my position, in my possessions. Do I have to leave all these things?. I cannot enjoy anymore my sleep, laziness, this, that? No, it’s not worth!.
Gurudeva, Paramahansa Yoganandaji, explains clearly that these negative tendencies are not going to give you permanent happiness. Your pride is not going to give you permanent happiness. Ego, desires, all these things one day you have to relinquish them. The process of relinquishing involves a battle, a struggle – Kurukshetra. That is what we are going to discuss.

With this, you know now, I’m not so much interested in that Kurukshetra war which took place some three thousand years ago somewhere out there in Haryana. I’m more concerned and interested about the Kurukshetra war that is taking place within me. Right here, right now — it’s taking place within me because I want divine kingdom. I want my rightful heritage. But for that, I have to fight this Kurukshetra war. I mean, that is the context we have to understand.
Clearly outlining, the Gita’s balanced path of meditation and right activity, Paramahansa Yoganandaji shows how we can create for ourselves a life of spiritual integrity, serenity, simplicity and joy. Through our awakened intuition, we come to know the right course to take at every crossroad on the path of life. That is very important for me. The guidance of Gita is not only for self-realization, it is also to take the right course of action at every crossroad in my life. It gives guidance for day-to-day life, day-to-day living.
The Assurance of God and the Necessity of Winning
Paramahansa Yoganandaji gives a grand assurance. Beautiful! He wrote: “As God talked with Arjuna, so will He talk with you.”. We know that Bhagavan Krishna talked to Arjuna. God, in the form of Krishna, talked to Arjuna. “As God talked with Arjuna, so He will talk with you. As He lifted up the spirit and consciousness of Arjuna, so will He uplift you. As He granted Arjuna supreme spiritual vision, so will He confer enlightenment on you.". Why? Because God has no favourites. If God gave enlightenment to Arjuna, He will give to me too, if only I want it, if only I work for it. That is the assurance.

Guruji also says, “Each person has to fight his own battle of Kurukshetra.”. We’re all well aware of it; We’re all fighting on a day-to-day basis. “Each person has to fight his own battle of Kurukshetra. It’s a war not only worth winning, but in the divine order of the universe and of the eternal relationship between the soul and God, a war that, sooner or later, must be won.”. So, it’s a war, not only worth winning, but by God’s design, this is a war that must be won, sooner or later. Let it be sooner. It is not a question that I am going to — whether I’m going to win this battle? No, it’s a question “When?”.
The words of Bhagawan Krishna to Arjuna in the Gita are at once, a profound scripture on the science of yoga, and a textbook for everyday living. That is more important for us now. It's a textbook for everyday living. Why should we understand Gita, study Gita? Here is the reason. Paramahansaji says: “The underlying essential truths of all great world scriptures can find common amity in the infinite wisdom of the Gita’s mere 700 concise verses. The entire knowledge of the cosmos is packed into the Gita. Wherever one is on the way back to God, the Gita will shed its light on that segment of the journey.”. Isn’t it beautiful?. It’s for everyone — beginners, veterans, and those who are somewhere in the middle. “Wherever one is on the way back to God, the Gita will shed its light on that segment of the journey.”. Everyone, any time, can be benefited.

One thing we have to understand, because this is a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, Guruji advises us, “Whenever Arjuna asks questions of God, it is to be understood that the meditating devotee by silent thoughts is communing with God.”. It is not that out there something is happening between Arjuna and Krishna. No! It is happening between me and God. That Arjuna in me! Arjuna is there in me, Arjuna devotee — he’s communing.
The Threefold Meaning of the Gita and the Bodies
Next. The threefold meaning of the Gita: – material, astral, and spiritual. See, man has three bodies: physical, astral, and causal bodies. To understand this, incarnate man — that is you and me — is encased in a physical body of inert matter which is animated by a subtle inner astral body of life energy and sensory powers. And both these physical and astral bodies have evolved from still subtler body, causal – causal body.
To demonstrate this, I used a glove last time. Suppose if I put on a glove to my hand and move. And glove is moving — that’s all what you see — glove is moving, but glove cannot move on its own. Glove is moving because my fingers are moving. My fingers are moving because of the instructions they receive from my thought. The glove is inert matter; on its own it cannot move — that is physical body. Physical body – inert matter, can’t move. That is operated by astral body — equivalent to the fingers – astral body of life energy and the sensory powers. And even fingers are moving because of the instructions received from the thought. That is causal body. Causal body operating fingers; fingers, in turn, operating glove. So physical, astral and causal body – we have three bodies.
In this overview, Bhagavad Gita gives instructions for all these, at all these levels, so that we are benefitted. All-round benefit we can get from this invaluable book, “God Talks with Arjuna.”.
“In this overview, the material interpretation of the Gita pertains to the physical and social duties and well-being of man.”. Physical duties, social duties, and general well-being of man. I mean these are at body level – physical.
“The astral is from the moral and psychological standpoint – man’s character resulting from the astral Nature-born sensory and life-energy principles that influence the formation of habits, inclinations and desires.”. So, my physical actions, that is one way — physical interpretation, material interpretation. Then the samskaras, my inclinations, the habits — that is astral level. Guidance is given, the psychological guidance is given.
And finally, “the spiritual interpretation is from the perspective of the divine nature and realization of the soul.”. So even at that level we can get guidance from “God Talks With Arjuna”: physical, astral and spiritual. So that is the introduction to this book, “God Talks With Arjuna.”.

## The First Sloka: Life as a Series of Battles

Then first sloka. First sloka, Dhritarashtra asks Sanjaya: “On the holy plain of Kurukshetra, gathered together, eager for the battle my children, Kauravas and Pandavas, what did they, O Sanjaya?”. That's the question put by Dhritarashtra, who was blind; he cannot see. So he asked his charioteer, Sanjaya, who was given that vision to see what was happening on the battlefield. Although he’s sitting in the palace, but he had that vision; He was granted that vision by Vedavyasa to see and narrate to blind King Dhritarashtra. So he asks, “What did Kauravas and Pandavas do on the battlefield?”.
See, the first sloka tells us a fundamental truth – that life is a series of battles. between Spirit and matter, knowledge and ignorance, soul and body, self-control and temptation. It’s all the way, all along — series of battles between good and bad, temptations and self-control, knowledge and ignorance – series of battles.
And each night, a sincere devotee must see in minute detail, how did he fare on that day in the battlefield of Kurukshetra within himself. One should see how did my good tendencies behave today and how my evil tendencies behave today. We have to see!. Now it may appear to be like writing a diary. No, it’s much more than that. Normally a diary mentions “What I did that day?”. But here a devotee should introspect “Why did I do, what I did today?”. What was the motive behind my actions, my behaviour, that is also important. Not only my actions, but even the motives are important if we are to progress spiritually. That is the import. Each day introspection should come into play.

Sanjay represents – introspection. Introspection has to give the account to Blind Mind. Mind cannot see. It can only interpret the information that’s coming from the senses.

## The Five Sheaths (Koshas) and Meditation

Next we have seen, “Why should I have all these struggles, trouble? I am divine. I am a spark of divinity. Then why do I go through these struggles? Why even I commit some mistakes?”. That's the question!. No doubt Divinity is within each one of us. But the soul is covered by layers of ignorance – layers of ignorance.
See, I’m covered – my soul is covered by five layers: the topmost being annamaya kosha, meaning matter sheath, matter cover. Below that is pranamaya kosha, life sheath. Then manomaya kosha, mind. Then jnanamaya kosha, discriminatory. And then anandamaya kosha. These are five covers, you know, which are hiding my soul.
So it takes effort to remove these covers, and that effort means struggle. There is a battle to remove cover after cover, so that when they are all removed, the pure soul merges in God. For this, meditation is the most effective way to remove these covers; because meditation involves pranayama, meaning prana-yama – control of life force.

When we are controlling life force, the life sheath comes under our control – that is removed. When it is removed one understands that when we have control over the force, we understand that this body is nothing but just delusory objectification. that is annamaya kosha, matter sheath also is revealed. And when life force comes under control, then senses are subdued.

Normally life force goes downwards along the spine and outward from the chakras. When they go outward from chakras, they go to senses and they energize them making them active. When we reverse this, – control of the life force means reversing the flow of life force, that is, from the senses draw them into chakras and take them upwards, rather than downwards and outwards, it becomes inward and upwards. That when senses are deprived of that life force they become subdued. and the mind doesn’t receive information from the senses. Mind comes under our control, not in the control of the senses. So, the mind sheath is rolled back.
Then comes to surface jnanamaya kosha. Man is mainly guided by the discrimination – jnana is discrimination. And further sadhana removes that sheath and man lives in bliss, ananda, because he’s covered by only anandamaya kosha, bliss sheath. And further sadhana removes even that anandamaya kosha – bliss sheath, so that the soul merges in — merges with Spirit, God. See, the sheath removal is not automatic. After a few years this is gone, after a few more years that is gone. No! It’s a struggle. It's effort. That is the Kurukshetra.
The Three Planes of Struggle

And here, this is happening at — There are three fields:

1. The Material and Moral Struggle (Sensory Plain of Kurukshetra): This is the struggle between good and evil, right and wrong actions, and on the sensory plain of Kurukshetra. If you recall the sloka, it says, “Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra” – the Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra. Kurukshetra refers to the sensory plain of Kurukshetra where the struggle is between good and bad, right and wrong actions. That is bodily plain.

2. Psychological War (Cerebrospinal Plain of Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra): This is the psychological war waged in yoga meditation on the cerebrospinal plain of Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra. Because in this cerebrospinal plane which is known as ‘Dharmakshetra Kurukshetra’ there are inclinations, good inclinations, bad inclinations, samskaras — they fight. That Kurukshetra is taking place.

3. Spiritual Battle (Cerebral Plain of Dharmakshetra): This takes place on the cerebral plain, cerebral plain – that's higher – that is Dharmakshetra, where we fight with our lower nature in order to conquer it and get back to God.
So, these are the three planes: bodily plain, then cerebrospinal plain, and then cerebral. Kurukshetra, Dharmakshetra-Kurukshetra, then Dharmakshetra.
And by now, you must have understood and got convinced that this guidance given by Bhagavad Gita is not only for ultimate self-realization — the goal of life. It is also useful, here and now, to lead a joyous purposeful life. That’s the beauty of Gita, it's useful for everyone whatever may be his level of progress in spirituality. It’s useful there. So that is a short recall of what we discussed in the first talk.

## The Second Sloka: Desire Approaches Habit

Now we will go to the second sloka. Before we start the explanation let us listen to the second sloka sung by Sw. Vasudevanandaji.

“saṁjaya uvāca: dṛṣṭvā tu pāṇḍavānīkaṁ vyūḍhaṁ duryodhanas tadā ācāryam upasaṁgamya rājā vacanam abravīt. dṛṣṭvā tu pāṇḍavānīkaṁ vyūḍhaṁ duryodhanas tadā ācāryam upasaṁgamya rājā vacanam abravīt”.

The plain meaning of this second sloka, goes like this: “Sanjaya said: Then King Duryodhana, after having seen the armies of the Pandavas in battle array repaired to his preceptor (Drona), and spoke as follows:”. Look at the continuity. Dhritarashtra asked Sanjaya, “What is happening on the battlefield?”. In response to that question, Sanjaya said: “King Duryodhana, after having seen the armies of Pandavas, he approached his guru, Dronacharya and spoke as follows”. That's all.

And many interpretations of Gita do not give much importance to this. It’s just like a fact, which was, of course, in a way. Duryodhana, having surveyed the armies of the enemies, approached his Acharya — Dronacharya to explain. But Guruji has gone deep into this. Metaphysical explanation is given which is very much applicable to you, and to me, in daily life. Duryodhana represents desire. Desire in me is Duryodhana. Dronacharya represents habit, samskara, inclinations – Dronacharya, past habit.

## The Alarm of Material Desire

Ordinary person, knowing nothing of the intoxicating joy that can flow from meditational practices innocently reconciles to sense pleasures. I mean, how true it is?. Many many people are not aware what joy meditation can give on a regular basis. They're not aware. In the absence of that knowledge that can come knowledge of joy that can come from meditation, the person reconciles to whatever sense pleasures he can have.

But when man starts meditation and gets that joy, you know, he becomes more and more interested in meditation then, the King Material Desire in me gets alarmed. “Oh! This man is now going towards meditation. That means, I may be deprived of my joys, my sense pleasures”. That desire, which was enjoying the pleasures coming from ears, and eyes and tongue. “Oh, I may be deprived”. It gets alarmed and turns towards past habit, Dronacharya – it turns.
Devotee, beware!. As soon as the spiritual aspirant tries to meditate and rouse the powers of self-control and discrimination, he will find King Material Desire tempting him in several ways to distract him from meditation. When he wants to meditate, sincerely someone wants to meditate immediately he remembers: “Oh! I have to call my friend. I promised. Let me call now”. “There's an excellent movie going on in the neighbouring theatre”. There’s a very interesting TV show – serial is going on!. Or “others are waiting for dinner”. “Let me get through all these duties. Later I can meditate”.

When all those things come to mind, these are the tempting by maya. We lost our divinity in the game of delusion. That delusion is even now working. When you want to meditate, all these things come to mind past habit – past things you have been doing it. And this is not only for spiritual aspirants, This is happening for students too. Only when a student sits for studies then he remembers about the TV program or about his friends.
Even the resolute devotee who resists these lures outwardly, resists and sits in meditation, then comes inner urges of past bad habits like restlessness, sleepiness, mental sloth. mental sloth meaning laziness, because meditation is intense activity. I won’t even say that meditation is an activity. 

Meditation is intense activity. Lot of effort is required.
The restless man who doesn’t cultivate spiritual discrimination and self-control becomes a victim of Duryodhana, Material Desires, temptations and of Drona samskaras, inner urges of past habits of spiritual indifference and sense pleasures. For example: Sleep gives me so much joy!. It’s so easy to sleep than to do meditation. If I go to meditation, I may not get what I expect immediately. It's not instant gratification of senses in meditation. It takes time, whereas here instant — if I sleep, I get rest. If I go to a movie, I kill time. That's all what I want – instant!. But meditation is work.

Pure enjoyments of senses. Experience with the spiritual discrimination and self-control are not enslaving. It doesn’t mean that a spiritual aspirant, a true devotee, should not indulge in sense pleasures. No!. We can involve in all these things. We can even watch TV. We can take food, but with some self-control. Some discrimination should be there. How much? How long?. If there is discrimination, self-control, all these things, pleasures, meant for senses, satisfying senses, they are all okay. They are good. But have that discrimination.
Thus, we find the second sloka of the Gita forewarning the spiritual aspirant that King Duryodhana, Material Desire, will try to arouse man's Drona, sense-habit tendencies to fight against the soul's forces of discrimination.

## Habit as an Ally: The Importance of Regularity

But there is hope. There is hope. Because Dronacharya was the guru of not only Kauravas, He was also the guru of Pandavas. Dronacharya trained both Pandavas and Kauravas, meaning habit could be a bad habit or it could be a good habit. Habit also could be a good habit. Take advantage of that.

Dronacharya, by force of circumstances, had to fight for Kauravas. But in his heart of hearts, he wanted victory for Pandavas. Although he wasn’t fighting for them, fighting against them, he wanted their victory, because that's truth. Similarly by nature, each one of us, we would like to be good. We would like to side with our soul nature rather than these materialistic pleasures. So inside that is there. If only we realize that and take advantage of that inner urge to be good, we will win the battle. And same Dronacharya will help us, same Habit will help us. So take advantage of that Habit, Dronacharya.
See what is habit in meditation? It is regularity. The importance of regularity in meditation cannot be over-emphasized. Many devotees do not continue with meditation because of that, because of lack of regularity. Regularity is very important especially in meditation.

Paramahansa Yoganandaji said: “The most destructive shaft of maya, delusion is unwillingness to meditate, for by this attitude, one prevents himself from tuning with God and guru.”. That is most, most destructive influence of maya – unwillingness to meditate. If somehow that unwillingness, delusion puts in me there itself, I am gone. So, we should never fall prey to this unwillingness.

Daya Mataji said, “If you are not regular at meditation, you will be a beginner even after twenty years.”. Mark her words. And this is valid for so many devotees we are seeing around. “If you are not regular at meditation, you will be a beginner even after twenty years.”. Same questions when you start; after five years, after ten years, fifteen years, twenty years, same questions because they are not regular. If you are not regular, you know how to handle thoughts, how to subdue the thoughts. That is possible with regularity.

## Advice on Daily Practice

Now, I would like to share with you a piece of advice I received from a friend of mine, when I just started meditation — that was about forty-two years back, 1979. I just started, a friend of mine gave this advice. “Never think whether to meditate or not. Just sit down and meditate.”.

If you think whether to meditate or not, immediately, you have a very pleasant advice coming from within. “You are too tired. You had a long day today. Others are waiting for common dinner. And, there is a serial on the TV, and you have to make a telephone call to a friend, right now, do it. Guruji will understand. You can compensate by a long meditation tomorrow. Tomorrow you can skip”. So many advices will come, if you think whether to meditate or not.
Interestingly, I never think whether to eat or not. I eat, a little late, a little early, little more or little less, I eat. I never think whether to sleep or not, I sleep. But, when it comes to meditation, there’s an option, whether to meditate or not?. Why should that be?. When you get up in the morning, either before bath or after bath, meditate. We have to meditate. It should be so much ingrained in us, that habit — that means, Dronacharya. Drona is helping us. Dronacharya will help us; the same habit can help us.

A devotee I know personally had a contract, a pact with Guruji. He would say, “Guruji, regularity at meditation is my responsibility, but going deep into meditation is your responsibility.”. We don’t have control over the depth of meditation. That’s why he said, “Regularity at meditation is my responsibility, but going deep into meditation is your responsibility.”. And the same devotee, with tears of gratitude, after years he said, “I have always received more than what I expected, more than what I needed, more than what I deserved.”. “My only effort was regularity. I was regular, I received so much.”. Dronacharya. Make use of that habit.

## The Elephant Analogy

Here is an analogy and how the habit helps — the positive habit, good habit helps, especially in spiritual practices. One king had, you know, a battalion of elephants. There was one elephant, which was very efficient at war. It won many a battle for the king, but with time it was becoming old. The king retired that elephant.
One day, that elephant went to a pond. After taking water before it came back, it got stuck in the mud of that pond. They put a rope around it, tried to pull it. Other elephants also tried to pull it. It couldn’t come. More and more, it was getting stuck and going into the mud.

Then, one monk advised, “King, you please bring war drums and blow them.”. Hearing this war cry, the elephant pulled out of the mud and started running on its own. It couldn’t come out even with the help of others but once it heard the war drums, now, it got all that enthusiasm, war cry, and came out of it because it was made for that, war. It was — that habit was there. Once it heard war drums, it was ready to fight.

Same thing with us. We should have that habit. It is like a war cry, need for meditation. That’s a war cry, “I have to go for meditation.”. When the thought comes, “meditation,” you get up, alarm or no alarm. If you don’t have the urge to go for that war in meditation, then alarm is not going to help you. Now this is time for meditation. Alarm is indicating — get up, war cry. That kind of habit should be there. Dronacharya is helping you, Pandavas, cause habit of meditation is a good one, good habit, positive habit. Cultivate that.
The Third Sloka: The Calm Inner Light of Intuitive Awakening
Now, we’ll go to third sloka. The plain meaning: Duryodhana said. “O Teacher, behold this great army of the sons of Pandu, arranged in battle order by thy talented disciple, the son of Drupada.”.

In third sloka, he says: “Acharya — O teacher, behold this great army of Pandavas arranged in the battle by the son of Drupada,” — that is Dhrishtadyumna, that much only.
Here, there is deep spiritual significance for you and for me. Dhrishtadyumna was the commander-in-general for Pandavas. The material desire in me (Duryodhana), when it observes that I am going toward spiritual practices, addresses habit (Dronacharya): “Behold the mighty army of Pandavas, the discriminative forces entrenched in the spiritual centres, all poised for battle under the direction of thy disciple Dhrishtadyumna, the calm, inner light of intuitive awakening.”.

Dronacharya represents habit. Habit cannot easily be conquered once it is formed. It is so strong, so difficult to remove it. Metaphysically saying that any habit can be completely removed by calm inner light of intuitive awakening — that has to come, that intuitive awakening should come from within. That can only destroy habit. Eventually, Dronacharya was killed by Dhrishtadyumna.

Dhrishtadyumna was the son of Drupada. Drupada represents dispassion — meaning vairagya for material enjoyment resulting from deep spiritual fervour and divine devotion. Drupada represents vairagya — that means dispassion for material enjoyments. So, that can only give this intuitive awakening within me, and that in turn can overcome a bad habit. There we need inner awakening.

How do you get that inner awakening? By deep meditation. That inner awakening when it comes, it comes with a calm, inner light. It can foresee — this is what is going to happen in the future if you continue with this habit. It can intuitively feel, this is what is going to happen, now I have to remove it. That kind of strength comes from meditation practices.

## The Story of Drupada and Dronacharya

Now, I will go to story, story of Drupada, Dhrishtadyumna, and Dronacharya. Dronacharya and Drupada were friends in the beginning. When Dronacharya needed material help, Drupada did not help, and Dronacharya felt humiliated. He took revenge by training Pandavas and asking them, as Guru Dakshina, to catch and imprison Drupada. Eventually, Drupada was caught as a prisoner by Dronacharya’s disciples.

When we start meditation initially, my habits also tend to help — initial enthusiasm. I start enjoying it. Automatically, I develop some vairagya, some dispassion and disinterest in normal activities. That means my sincere effort is helped, cooperated by my habits, also. But after some time, the habit sees that, “Oh, if he’s going, continuing in this direction, I’m going to be starved”. So, it rebels. After initial enthusiasm, our past habits overtake and kill that interest in meditation. Our past bad habits come back and catch us so that we leave our spiritual practices.

In the Mahabharata story, Drupada did not take it easily. He did very vigorous tapas, very vigorous spiritual practices with the sole aim of having a son who would kill Dronacharya with revenge. From that fire, Dhrishtadyumna comes out. He was blessed with a son coming from fire.

Similarly, after starting meditation, our old habits, bad habits, especially, overpower us, dissuade us. We have to develop that inner awakening. Somehow, we have to go on doing some kind of practices. Then comes that intuitive awakening, which can really conquer our bad habits. That’s how Dronacharya was killed eventually — because of tapas done by Drupada. Similarly, I will definitely conquer all my lower nature, all my negative tendencies, by involving with resolute determination in meditation and other spiritual practices.
Overcoming Bad Habits

The man who is always restless and who never meditates believes that he is ‘all right’. He realizes the true plight as soon as spiritual desire awakens in him and he tries to meditate and be calm. He then naturally meets fierce resistance from the bad habits of mental fickleness.
To watch some movie for three hours, I sit before a TV, surrender to TV. Next two hours you can be there watching — watching news — no problem of concentration. But you go and sit in meditation, fifteen minutes is a big struggle. That is why we are finding it difficult to meditate — meditate initially.

Guruji’s advice: “It is much more difficult for the occult soldiers in reclaiming the kingdom of peace once it has fallen into the hands of King Material Desire. One, therefore, must make the most of his spiritual inclination while the forces of his willingness to meditate are strong. It is good to start meditation at an early age; or, failing that, to start meditation on a regular daily schedule as soon as the mental discriminative inclination develops.”.

Once we realize that spiritual pursuits are very important for a human being, then immediately start the spiritual practices like meditation. It’s never too late to start, although it is more and more difficult, but never too late.
Guruji gives a beautiful summary of third sloka. Thus, it is explained in this verse that when Material Desire and his army of sense tendencies and their restless thoughts try to reinforce themselves by Past Material Habit in order to dissuade the spiritual aspirant from the practice of meditation, they find that the Calm Inner Light of awakening intuition, well trained in meditation by Past Spiritual Habit, has effectively arrayed the discriminative faculties to give metaphysical resistance.

By nature, every devotee has that inner urge to progress spiritually by sadhana. But unfortunately, the habits of procrastination, laziness, tendency for instant material gratifications — sense gratifications — they oppose, they dissuade, because we want instant happiness. So, lie on the bed, instant happiness; sit before the TV, instant happiness; take a phone call, instant pleasure. These things dissuade us although inside we are interested to do something noble, something higher.

## The Bird and the Rod Analogy

Now, how do we conquer our habits, bad habits?. Wrong thinking, or idle thinking — that's a bad habit. I have an analogy. A hunter normally catches birds by casting a net. But there is one bird which cannot be caught by a net. This hunter uses a very intelligent trick to catch it. He puts a rod on two hinges on the branch of a tree. This particular bird, when it comes and it lands on the rod, the rod turns on the hinges. When it turns, the bird goes upside down. And it thinks that if it leaves the rod, it’ll go and hit the ground and die. It’s afraid. It catches so fast that it doesn’t want to leave the rod, although it has the capacity to leave the rod and fly into safety before it touches the ground. It never leaves the rod and the hunter comes and catches it.

Same thing with us. I’m now hooked to a bad habit. I think that I can’t survive by leaving it. We think, I can’t live without this. But you can!. You have that capacity, being divine. You are a spark of Divinity. You have that capacity to fly into freedom before you hit the ground. You have that capacity to leave this bad habit which is troubling you again and again. It’s possible.

When will you leave? When that awakening comes. The awakening comes, intuitive awakening. Yes. Now I can leave. If I — if I don’t leave, this is what is going to happen to me, my life. Let me leave this rod, let me leave this habit and fly into freedom. Let us have that calm inner light of intuitive awakening generated by meditation. Meditation is there again, that is the solution. Then we can definitely kick the habits, definitely one by one, one by one.

## Review and Conclusion

Now, let us just review what we have done today.
After reviewing what we said in the last talk, we went to second sloka where Duryodhana, having surveyed the armies of Pandavas and approached his guru, Dronacharya, and spoke. That is when a devotee starts meditating, the material desire in him gets alarmed. So [Desire] tries to dissuade the devotee by bringing into his mind all those past memories of habits, those pleasures he used to get. So beware, beware. Take advantage of this habit by cultivating good habits like regularity in meditation. Then Dronacharya is going to help you rather than helping Kauravas. That’s the second sloka.

Third sloka is Pandavas are helped by Dhrishtadyumna as the commander-in-chief. Dhrishtadyumna was born to kill Dronacharya, the habit. So, the bad habits in me are going to be killed. For that, we have to cultivate or generate Dhrishtadyumna — that is calm inner light of intuitive awakening by meditation practices. Then we’ll have the power to conquer whatever bad habits we have. This is for today.

Next time we’ll take up slokas four, five, and six. Pandavas were only five. Eventually they won the battle of Kurukshetra, not by themselves — they needed help of many supporters, many allies. Similarly, my, a few good qualities, like yama-niyama, pranayama, self-control, calmness — alone may not be adequate to win this battle. I also need the help of some supporting qualities like discriminative intelligence. I need devotion. I need vairagya, dispassion. All these qualities also I need in order to win the ultimate battle of delusion. So that’s what we’ll discuss — what are the other good spiritual qualities we have to develop in order to win this Kurukshetra within. That will be topic for the next talk.
Okay. A few moments of silence and then we leave. Aum. Shanti. Shanti. Shanti. Jai Guru.
