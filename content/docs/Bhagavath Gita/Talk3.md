## Winning the Battle of Life (Kurukshetra Within Me) - Part 3

love and greetings to all of you from yoga sangha ashrams welcome to today's discourse which is the third in a series of talks on the wisdom of bhagavad-gita as interpreted by gurudev params yogananda ji in his book God Talks with Arjuna. in the first talk we understood the uniqueness of this interpretation. let us recall the words of encouragement given by paransiji: "Each person has to fight his own battle of kurukshetra". "it is a war not only worth winning but in the divine order of the universe and of the eternal relationship between the soul and god a war that sooner or later must be one". meaning thereby the kurukshetra word that is going on within us that will be won by you and by me. it's not a question of whether we will win it's a question of when. let it be sooner. further paranji assured as: "god talked with arjuna so will he talk with you as he lifted up the spirit and consciousness of arjuna so will he uplift you as he granted arjuna supreme spiritual vision so will he confer enlightenment on you". i mean that is the assurance he has given really great assurance.

## The First Sloka: Wisdom and Ignorance

then we studied the first loka of the first chapter which tells us a fundamental truth that "life is a series of battles between wisdom and ignorance soul and body self-control and temptation discrimination and the senses". "The human body is a veritable battleground of war between wisdom and ignorance". the import of the first sloka. every night a sincere devotee must dispassionately introspect and see how his good tendencies and bad tendencies were on that day. that is the meaning of this verse.

### The Second Sloka: The Influence of Past Habit (Drona)

next second sloka gives us a warning and asks us to be aware of the influence of past bad habits. we find the second verse of the Gita forewarning the spiritual aspirant that "king duryodhana material desire will try to arouse man's drona sense habit tendencies to fight against the soul forces of discrimination". the explanation given by guruji goes like this: the ordinary person knowing nothing about the intoxicating joy that can flow from meditation unwittingly reconciles himself to sense pleasures. because he doesn't know that there could be so much joy in meditation he just settles down to sense pleasures like whatever one gets through eyes that is watching tv and other things he is little bit happy whatever he can get through ears whatever he can get through tongue food is happy sense pleasures. but when that awakening comes and starts meditating then the king material desire inside gets alarmed. what this person now is going towards spirituality he is trying to enjoy the soul qualities inside that means that my material desires are going to be ignored they're going to starve. so in alarmingly he invokes the past habit dranacharya. "beware devotee that when you start meditation so many things will be there so many temptations all result of past bad habits". when we meditate rather when we sit for meditation that time only we get an idea oh i have that unfinished work immediately i have to do that i have to call my friend and finish that job. an interesting serial is going on on the tv an excellent movie in the neighboring theater others are waiting for dinner tomorrow i will compensate by a long meditation. something other will come to dissipate you from meditating. know that this is the temptation by past bad habits. and even for those devotees who are beyond these temptations and sit for meditation they have to again face the influence of past bad habits of restlessness sleepiness you know spiritual indifference even after sitting for meditation. that is also influence of maya fast bad habits so we have to be aware that there are going to be many temptations to prevent us from meditating. but there is hope. dronacharya was the guru of not only of kauravas he was also the guru of pandavas meaning habit could be bad or it could be good. let us cultivate good habits that means take advantage of same dronach area to help us in reality. although dradacharya by force of circumstances fought for kauravas "in heart of hearts he wanted pandavas to win". similarly although bad habits are there trying to dissipate us but good habits are there wanting us wanting us to go word to have spiritual progress. i mean that is the essence of second sloka.

## The Third Sloka: Intuitive Awakening

then third sloka it is explained in this verse that when material desire and his army of sense tendencies and their restless thoughts try to reinforce themselves by past material habit in order to dissipate the spiritual aspirant from the practice of meditation they find that the calm inner light of awakening intuition trained in meditation by past spiritual habit has effectively arrayed the discriminative faculties to give metaphysical resistance. that means inside there is so much good in each one of us. by nature every devotee has that inner urge to progress spiritually by sincere sadhana. like every student would like to study well to have a prosperous career but unfortunately the habits of procrastination laziness and the tendencies to have instant gratification of senses try to impede our spiritual progress. and here the way to overcome is to conquer those bad habits and the habits so much ingrained here can only be removed completely by that "calm inner light of intuitive awakening". when that awakening comes inner conviction it throws light intuitive light it could see the influence of this habit where it's going to take us to and in that light he he has that power too to eliminate this habit. drunacharya was very powerful he was a very strong warrior. eventually he was killed by dr jimna who stands for calm inner light of intuitive awakening. but how did he come about? he was the offspring of drupada. drupata did intense tapas with the intention of having a son to kill radacharya. he came out of fire. similarly we have to generate that calm inner light of intuitive awakening by deep meditation. when we do deep meditation definitely that inner awakening comes and that will help us to eliminate our bad habits from the roots so that they don't recur. that was about thirds third sloka.

## Slokas 4, 5, and 6: The Spiritual Soldiers

now we'll we will take up fourth fifth and slokas together. before we start the explanation let us listen to the slokas four five and six sung by swami vasdevanji is my the plain meaning of these four three slokas duryodhana continues here present are mighty heroes extraordinary bowmen as skillful in battle as bhima arjuna veteran warriors yudhana virata drupada the powerful ketu caitanya raja imminent among men the strong the valiant mahajas abhimanyu sons of draupadi and all maharadis lots of great chariots. recall that after drastic asked sanjay what is happening on the battlefield sanjay through his intuition he could see what was happening and he was narrating. duryodhana having surveyed the rvs of pandavas approached his guru gurudev dranach area and started explaining these are the warriors ready to fight on behalf of pandavas these are the warriors. there is an analogy here. eventually pandavas won the kurukshetra war we know that. it wasn't just the five pandavas who were able to win the war they needed the support of many allies many people came in their support and fought on their behalf. here i am fighting my inner kurukshetra trying to overcome my lower tendencies negative tendencies. for this my five pandavas like yama niyama self-control pranayama calmness represented by nakul sahadev arjun bhim yudhisthira these five are not adequate to win this battle of inner kurukshetra. i also need the support of other qualities like devotion discriminative intelligence spiritual memory all these are also are needed for me. like pandavas needed the help of drupada virata kunti bhoja kashi raja like other kings help them similarly i need many qualities other than yama nima self-control pranayama and these are the qualities first duryodhana is recognizing in identifying oh they are there they are going to fight my material desires.
and guruji explains in verses 4 5 and 6: "king material desire duryodhana informs his preceptor fast habit drona about the spiritual soldiers in the cerebrospinal centers that have lined up in the battle array". these metaphysical soldiers which have gathered to support the cause of the five pandavas are the spiritual effects gathered by the devotees practice of yoga. let's try to understand these metaphysical soldiers are there in cerebrospinal centers in centers they are there but they have to be awakened they have to awaken then they become powerful and help our mission of self-realization. they are there but dormant we ought to awaken them by meditation. one thing here we should remember a person need not be born with all these divine qualities. need not be not necessarily to be born with these qualities we can gather these qualities acquire these qualities as we go along in our sadhana. i mean that is the soles. even if i'm missing the devotion the faith that spiritual memory it's all right i can gather as i go along. that's why guruji says these are the "spiritual effects gathered by devotees practice of yoga". so as we practice yoga we can gather these good qualities.
one more point even if god realization is not our present goal the aim of life is to "avoid pain and attain permanent bliss". no one can deny this that is a goal everyone is trying to achieve avoid pain and suffering and attain permanent bliss. and these qualities which we are going to study are going to help us in achieving this goal of permanent happiness. these good qualities are necessary not only for self-realization ultimate goal of life but they are also useful in our day-to-day life to have a smooth and purposeful and joyous existence in this world of duality. they help us in many ways. next let us see who are this metaphysical soldiers.

## Yudhana: Divine Devotion (Shraddha)
duryodhana identifies them as yu dhana. yudhana is a warrior who fought for pandavas. he represents in guruji's interpretation divine devotion shraddha. guruji wrote: "divine devotion shraddha fights the forces of irreverent satanic disbelief or doubt which try to dissipate and discourage the aspirant". and when we have devotion doubts take no they take much lesser importance. generally speaking in spiritual life there are three doubts. one whether god exists and is finding god the goal of life that's the first doubt. second is will the path i chose lead me to that ultimate goal of self-realization i mean doubts about the path we are following. third doubt is we with all these shortcomings and faults me am i qualified for self-realization can i ever with all these things because i am aware of my defects shortcomings i mean that is third doubt. first is about the existence of god and goal of life second is doubting about the pathway following is it effective third is myself me am i qualified. doubts cannot be quelled by a reason alone because "reason is clouded under doubt". when the doubt you can't logically explain to your mind no no no because reason is clouded under doubt. then what is required is devotion and faith. "Just move on with devotion and faith move on with your spiritual practices in time all these doubts will be blown away". that is where devotion and faith come to our aid in our self-realization. doubts can be quelled in time with devotion and faith. meaning that we should not wait till all our doubts are clarified to start practicing meditation and other spiritual exercises no no. we with all the doubts we can start. one by one doubts will get clarified. one more thing now sometimes we get answers to the doubts that means properly they are clarified. sometimes doubts fade into insignificance there's no more a doubt not that we have the answer it's of no importance to us it just just fades away. so what is required is the divine devotion faith to proceed on the spiritual path. so devotion fights the forces of irreverent satanic disbelief or doubt which try to dissipate and discourage the aspirant how true it is.

## Caitanya: Spiritual Memory

next another warrior who helped pandavas who is going to help us in our spiritual search and daily living is caitanya. he represents spiritual memory. and god talks with arjuna guruji wrote: "spiritual memory stands in readiness to oppose the material delusion that makes man forget god and consider himself a body bound mortal being". let's try to understand this. if someone asked you who are you what is the answer in general who are you? normally i answer i am an engineer i'm a gujarati i'm a hindu i'm an indian isn't it true? that's how we are we did introduce ourselves. remember these are the roles i am playing that's not my true nature. i get so much attached with the role i am playing and i forget about my goal because i don't have that spiritual memory. how are you will your answer "ahambram ask me i am brahman i am a spark of divinity" will you ever answer? because you don't remember that aham brahma that is spiritual memory. "ahm brahmasmi i'm a spark of divinity" that we should remember then life is not going to be so disappointing. now i'll just give an example say i am an indian i mean there's nothing wrong it's good i can be very proud of it but i get so much identified that i am an indian and in so much so that if indian team loses a hockey match against some australia or some other team all day long i keep worried why why my team lost why india lost why india lost. at that point if you think that aham brahmasmi i am brahman here are two teams team a and team b exhibiting their skills. team a1 today let me enjoy the skills they are exhibiting but identifying that pains us. of course living in this world we cannot be totally aloof there's nothing wrong in wanting my team my indian team my my state team to win that is fine but if it loses maybe a few minutes you feel uncomfortable few minutes or maybe an hour you feel still think about it but all day long to think about why did it happen why did it happen there we are making a mistake. like living more like mortal being identifying with all these things. remember if there is spiritual memory ahambramhasmi then the pain is not so much the pain is not so much. so that is required in daily life that non-attachment know that in this incarnation i am so and so i'm in this incarnation i am playing a role here that's not my goal. being an engineer is not my goal i i just play that role.

## Virata: Samadhi (Ecstasy)

another king who fought and helped pandavas virata he represents samadhi ecstasy. guruji wrote: "samadhi routes the delusion that has made the soul behold through its ego nature not the one true spirit but the diverse forms of matter and pairs of opposites". "before the rightful discriminative qualities can regain their kingdom the devotee must draw those qualities from his experiences in samadhi meditation". who was virata? virata was king of that country where pandavas took shelter in the 13th year when they were to be they were to be in agnyatvas that means in disguise not to be identified by kawarawas. they were in these guys in that year they spent in virat kingdom and whose king was virata. see that year they were not only fulfilling the conditions of the game of dice spending one year in exile they were also making strategies planning for the upcoming kurukshetra work. they were planning also how to go about it strategies they were making alliances for instance arjun's son abhimanyu was married to virat's daughter uttara thus that's how they made that alliance and virata fought for them all that was happening in that year preparation. similarly when we meditate that ecstasy the joy that joy gives us so much strength to fight that inner kurukshetra. now it helps us so enjoy enjoy that ecstasy the result of meditative efforts. the longer you spend in that in the state better you are as a warrior to fight the inner kurukshetra. so it is necessary necessary for us to have the help of virata meaning it's necessary for us to spend time in that ecstasy after meditation.

## Kashi Raja: Discriminative Intelligence (Prajna)

another king kashi raja. guruji wrote: "discriminative intelligence pragma represented by kashiraja protects the devotee from the entrapment by the cunning troops of false reasoning". no man is guided by reason. the reason is not always correct sometimes very false but he thinks that is correct you know. whereas discriminative intelligence that pregnant that helps us to be not trapped by this false reasoning of my own mind. pragma is not the mere intellect of the scholar bound by logic reason and memory but an expression of the divine faculty of the supreme knower. i mean our reason is what reason is guided by logic i mean experience previous experience but pragma is something beyond. it is the faculty that intuitive faculty of the supreme knower that we have to develop that intuition. again meditation is the source to develop that pregnya.

## Drupada: Extreme Dispassion (Vairagya)

another warrior who helped pandavas drupada. drupada we know we already discussed about him because whose son was dhrushar jimna who eventually killed the past habit guranacharya. in god talks with arjuna param ji wrote: "extreme dispassion that is drupada supports the devotees fight against the strong army of material attachment that seeks to turn him from his spiritual goal". dispassion that means thirsam vega meaning vairagya dispassion disinterest you know vairagya. now in spiritual literature raja comes quite often. you should have that vairagya you should have that dispassion for things of the world. but the real meaning of vairagya dispassion is given here by guruji in this book very important to know very important. now what does it mean by varagya? guruji wrote: "dispassion meaning vairajya is not a negative disinterest a deprived state of renunciation". i mean that's a key. it's not a deprived state of renunciation. the meaning of the word rather encompasses such an such an ardent devotion for attaining the spiritual goal a feeling that stirs the devotee into positive action and mental intensity that longing for the world is transmuted naturally into a fulfilling desire for god. that is the key. it is vairagya a normal connotation is negative you know renunciation deprived state. but that should come from a positive quality of desire for god then only varaga has meaning. "a feeling that stirs the devotee into positive action and mental intensity so that the longing for the world material things is transmuted by an intense desire for god" then only it has meaning. it's not the renunciation that matters it is the desire for god love for god that matters then only this renunciation is meaningful. now it's something like this can we tell god god i leave this i don't want that i leave that i need i don't need that give yourself to me. it doesn't work work that way. just because you are leaving these things you are renouncing these things god doesn't himself to you. rather you can even say that lord i cannot live without this i need this still i can't leave that i want that but "lord i also want you" that is more important. i also want you is more important because in practical life i can't live this i can't live without these things it's my it's my duty to have these things but i also want you that is more important. i want you that is more important.

now here i would like to share some advice given by Dayamathaji. she said if you cannot say that "i want you" if you are not you know if you are not sincere sincere if you don't feel like saying "i want you Lord" you say "i want to want you Lord". if you cannot say that you say "i want to want to want you Lord". even if that is difficult to start with you can say "lord i want to want to want to want you" that means you start. we may not have that desire for god strongly but have a desire to have the desire for god. now ask god that will give what is meant by desire for god means i want to be a better human being essentially i mean that is desire for god. i want to be a better human being. when i become really a perfect human being there i am with god i'm the divinity i achieve when i become a perfect human being. so my desire is to become that perfect human being i want that this i have the desire for god. let's cultivate that then the renunciation we feel the disinterest in material objects of this world that has meaning that has meaning. now the basis for varagya should be desire for god. now guruji said you know beautiful his quotation about this: "the love for god becomes manifest in you not merely by peace of mind nor even by burning zeal but by calm devotional will for perfection". look at these words only navatar can express that way. meaning love for god is not passive i love for god that manifests in you as "calm devotional will for perfection" that is real love for god. whatever you are doing you would like to do perfectly that is love for god. it's not just an emotion love for god desire for god devotion for god it's not just an emotion that manifests eventually saying that the calm devotional will for perfection that is desire for god. now in second chapter of Gita bhagavan krishna says: yoga karma meaning excellence in action is yoga. one of the definitions of yoga is that excellence in action is yoga. guruji said: "yoga is the art of proper action". that is yoga. you know yoga has several meanings to have that union with god we need to have develop the art of proper action. that calm devotional will for perfection then that desire for god becomes vairagya dispassion for material things that will help us in our search for god self-realization.

## Ketu: Yama (Mental Resistance)

next ketu is yama saviya is niyama. the power of mental resistance yama battles the desires to indulge in behavior that is contrary to spiritual law and helps to neutralize the karmic effects of past mistakes. see the depth of meaning. ema it battles the desire to indulge in behavior that is contrary to spiritual law and helps to neutralize the karmic effects of past mistakes. and emma has five principles. emma means things we should not do thou shall not abstaining. abstaining from injury to others falsehood stealing incontinence and covetousness these five things we have to avoid.

## Savia: Niyama (Mental Adherence)

next warrior is savia niyama. guruji wrote: "the power of mental adherence that is niyama provides the yogi with an army of positive spiritual self-discipline to defeat the battalions of evil misery producing ways and effects of past bad karma". these are dao shells that means the dose purity of body and mind contentment in our circumstances self-discipline self-study that is contemplation and devotion to god these are the five principles under nema we need to follow. yama nema do's and don'ts. yama and nima are the foundation on which the yogi begins to build his spiritual life. they harmonize body and mind with the divine loss of creation producing an inner and outer well-being. now we all know this yemen yamaneima do's and don'ts and they are there in other religions too not only in hinduism patanjali yoga sutras it is everywhere. in christianity we have ten commandments same thing moral principles do's and don'ts are given in ten commandments. and in buddhism the noble eight-fold path of buddha the noble eightfold path these are all same different names and that every religion has.

when we hear these words yama nema do's and don'ts the commandments the ten commandments these words sound harsh isn't it true? no one wants to be commanded no one wants to be imposed you have to do this you cannot do this. but see this is ego. "the ego thinks that these principles are given to me to curtail my freedom that's not true". the truth is our ancient rishis saints out of deep sympathy for you and for me they have given this code of conduct so that "we live a life free from suffering and fear and a life of joy". so these are required not only for god realization these are required even for my daily living here right now here if i follow this i have a more joyous life and eventually of course that's going to lead to self-realization. if any time you feel this is too much these cut telling my freedom means that coming from ego under the influence of maya delusion. the code of conduct given to us out of sympathy by our ancient saints rishis. swami chidananji our president gave a beautiful talk on this topic of yama nima way back in 2012 2011. you know he has he pointed something which i will share with you he said listen to this yama niyama which have come from yoga sutras from higher ages not this materialistic age higher ages. yama and yamas have come from higher ages listen to them and try to find out what is your soul response. when soul listens to that ahimsa non-injury to others soul will feel "yes that is what i want to be that's my nature i don't want to hurt anyone". the whole soul response contentment under all circumstances santosh when soul hears that "yes that is what i want to be" soul can relate to that. but it is mind under the influence of maya it says that these are all restrictive they are cutting my freedom. yamaneima remember that they are readed forever happy living here and today not only for self-realization. and no ego keeps saying you know stay away from mnema you don't have to follow but meditate meditation is okay but mnema not so important it doesn't work that way. meditation has to be compatible now with the life we are leading. but of course now it's not that we have to perfect our yam nima before we start meditating no it's not that way. wherever we are we can start meditating but have an eye and your behavior in following yama niyama

## Kunti Bhoja: Asana (Right Posture)

next warrior kunti bhoja. guruji describes kuntu bhoja represents asana right posture provides the physical and mental pacification necessary to fight the body-bound tendencies toward laziness restlessness and flesh attachment. so kunti bhoja was the king who adopted kunti mother of pandavas she was adopted by kunti bhoja that's why she got that name kunti. as kunti bhoja adopted and reared kunti "so does asana support the ability to invoke divine life energy in preparation for the practice of pranayama". asana is important for effective practice of pranayama techniques meditation so it's an important warrior in our search for god. awesome proper posture is an important warrior in our path yoga apart. asana is not very complicated we have only two things that are important. spine has to be straight and gaze upwards here the point between the two eyebrows cut as the center we have to focus here and spine has to be straight because so much is happening the spine when you are practicing meditation like life was going up and down so spine has to be straight not hunch back and gaze should be always up. when gaze is on level it is jagratabas wakeful state thoughts dominate. if i balls come down that is subconscious state we go to sleep. if i stay up that is "super conscious state spiritual consciousness". so throughout our meditation we have to make every effort to keep the gaze up preferably focused here. so these are the only two points gauge upwards spine straight whether you sit on the floor on a chair it doesn't matter that is our kunti bhoja asana. patanjali says "asan should be study and pleasant" so it doesn't cause any discomfort to us but study no movements.

## Yudhamanyu: Pranayama (Life Force Control)

Patanjali next warrior yudha manu he represents pranayama. yudhoyono is pranayama obviously is a is a very important warrior we need in our spiritual life. guruji writes: "life force control pranayama is the invaluable warrior in the pandava army that disarms and renders powerless the sense army of the blind mind". see mind is blind represented by dhutarastra. the tastra was born blind throughout his life he had to depend on others for information. similarly my mind is blind in the sense that mind cannot see or hear it it is senses that gather information pass on to the mind. eyes bring some information and mind being blind it depends on the eyes for information yes for the information. if ears bring some wrong information by mistake mind in enterprise the same way it takes it for granted. so mind is blind depending on senses. pranayama helps to free the soul from this influence of blind mind how? see purana life force that enters the body through medulla it goes down the spine. it flows down the spine and at each chakra in the spine it goes outwards to senses and other body parts. it take even chakra it goes and energizes the body parts. so the flow of life force is downwards and outwards downwards around the spine outward from each chakra to body parts. in the process life force goes and energizes the senses eyes yes skin tongue nose all the senses are energized by the life force that is coming down and flowing out. and these senses are active now they are fed by life force and when active they bring information and person to mind so mind is always dependent on the senses rather influenced by the senses. whatever mind wan senses want it obese. pranayama is prana yama. prana means life force yama is control. control of life force means we reverse this flow of life force inward and upward from senses. we draw the life force into the spine chakras and in this point they go up towards inward and upward reversing the direction. when the life force is removed from the senses the senses are subdued like in sleep i don't listen in sleep because life force is removed from my ears. similarly ics nose etc. doing pranayama by doing pranayama we draw this life force on the senses making them inactive. when they are inactive mind is not under the influence of the senses blind mind is not under the inferior senses. so that's what we want mind has to be under the influence of the soul not on the senses that is done by pranayama represented by yudha manu.

## Purujit: Pratyahara (Interiorization/Stillness)

next warrior is purujit. purujit represents pratyahara interiorization or stillness. guruji writes: "mental interiorization pratyahara provides the yogi with that steadiness of mental calm that prevents the prenatal habits of the sense army from causing sudden scattering of the mind and the material world". it's not very difficult to understand. see when the life force is withdrawn from the senses senses are subdued and mind is free from the influences then there is interiorization you go inside. other senses keep us in touch with outside world senses outside world but when they are cut off we are inside like in sleep. sleep i don't see i don't hear i don't taste but unfortunately mind is not in my control it's subconscious state. but in meditation senses do not function like in sleep to a certain extent at the same time mind is active consciousness is alive and that is interiorized state known as pratyahara interiorization stillness. i mean one should remember the goal of any meditation is pratyahara not pranayama as some people think. goal of meditation is not pranayama its goal of meditation is pratyahara that interiorization. when we interiorized you are in that wondrous inner world not thoughts no thoughts inside no feelings no sensations no dependence and any information that normally comes to the senses it is inside who are you inside the divinity. so it is so important to get used to that interiorization that can only be achieved through pranayama. by practicing pranayama senses are subdued and interiorization is felt stillness.

here i would say that interiorization prachyahara is both an effort and a result. interiorization is a result in the sense when we practice pranayama the result is prachahara interiorization that's true. but always it doesn't happen when you practice pranayama for some time and you may not necessarily get that tinterization stillness. there you have to put in a little more effort that is don't leave don't leave the meditation thinking that today my mind is still hesitated restlessness is there maybe i don't have that stillness today i don't integration don't think that way. pranayama is over pranayama means what practice of technique home technique kriya technique all these things are pranayama procedures you finish that. even if restlessness is there sit there sit there i sit definitely because i allowed so much time for interiorization stillness practice of stillness i sit there. if mind is restless look at kutasa visualize your estradiva bhagavan krishna or guruji or someone visualize and if you required you say omg krishna krishna krishna mentally chant after three four five minutes then comes that stillness definitely it comes although it wasn't there that means i made further effort to get that. remember that the goal of your meditation is stillness. otherwise you are not taking advantage of warrior just leave. and what happens here in stillness one of the most captivating and pleasant benefit for me is experience experiencing that inner joy. otherwise inner joy is only theory just we keep hearing what is inner joy but if you have that stillness it's no more a word a phrase inner jaw it's experience. that's why i often say that the characteristic the chief characteristic of a yoga devotee is experience. he experiences yoga the devotee after practicing that inner joy for that you have to cultivate that pandava warrior purujit. you have to practice stillness prachyahara and here that all our doubts are clarified you know about god existence of god nature of god all these things you yourself feel that not through intellect but by experience that is the importance of stillness.
now guruji said: "when bliss comes over you you recognize that as a conscious intelligent universal being to whom you may appeal and not as an abstract mental concept". mark his words. when the joy comes in stillness after meditation that joy is not simple joy. when we see i i feel joyful when i eat some nice food or meet a person it's not that kind of joy. here when the joy comes in stillness you recognize the joy as a conscious intelligent universal being to whom you may appeal meaning that the joy comes with a sense of higher presence. it's not just joy the joy comes with the conviction of the existence of a higher being higher principle. i mean that is that is the goal of meditation that you should always say remember that aim that never leave your meditation without spending some time in stillness prachara.

## Abhimanyu: Samyama (Self-Mastery)

next warrior is abhimanyu. we know abhimanyu was the offspring of arjuna and subhadra. he represents self-mastery samyama in sanskrit samyam self-mastery. self-mastery son of self-control arjun stands for self-control. guruji wrote: "self-mastery is that great pandava warrior whose victories enable the yogi to hold back the onslaught of the restless delusion consciousness of ego senses and habits and thus to remain longer and longer in the state of divine soul consciousness both during and after meditation". see during meditation feeling joy is something that effect of meditation you know at the end of meditation you feel but if you have that self mastery we enjoy the benefit of meditation for longer and longer durations even after meditation. meaning we take the benefits of meditation into our daily activities through the help of abhimanyu that is self-mastery. he represents dharan jaan samadhi three aspects he represents.

guruji wrote: "the five steps are the preliminaries of yoga". what are the five steps? as we saw yama niyama asana pranayama pratyahara they are the primaries of yoga. samyama consists of the akul trio dharana dhyana samadhi concentration meditation and divine union and is "yoga proper". "when mind is withdrawn from the sensory disturbances the then dharana and dhyana in conjunction produced the varying stage of samadhi extractic realization and finally divine union". here let's understand what are these words dharana dhyana samadhi. after pranayama and pratyahara literally means concentration. inshallah was wondering what is concentration after pranayama after prachiya there is a degree of concentration already but again what is concentration and then dhyana and samadhi it's like this this is yogic concentration. normally concentration means what in in the normal common common parlance concentration means take an object and study various characteristics of that object keep on studying then that is you are concentrating on that object that's fine. in yogic concentration you become one with that object and then understand about that object. you become one with that object that is dharana yoga concentration one with that object. when you become one with that object there's nothing like studying you are just you are observing you are one with that you know everything about that object no no need to concentrate. you are that dharana that's what happens when we're practicing say womb technique we concentrate and that's on on that cosmic sound womb. it's not just listening to womb we try to become one with that sound that is one big one with that sound dharana at the highest concentration. and womb is one aspect of god sound vibration. god has various aspects many manifestations god is light god is love god is joy god is wisdom all these things. it could be just the joy one with the joy inside that is dharana. one way is that light inside dharana one with that sound wisdom anything. and when you are enjoying that one with that sound inside of that joy inside that is dharana. afterwards further sadhana if you are able to feel that oneness with that cosmic sound even outside the body or that the joy on outside the body one with the joy even outside the body that becomes meditation. and further expansion is union with the divine light divine joy samadhi. these are the stages dharana micro jana macro and further samadhi. first inside and then even outside and then goes beyond. dharana and samadhi these three are represented by abhi menu.

## Sons of Draupadi: Spiritual Manifestations

then another another set of warriors mentioned by duryodhan literally means sons of draupadi. guruji wrote: "the manifestations characteristic of each of the five awakened spinal centers such as the specific forms lights or sounds characteristic of each center upon which the yogi concentrates to draw divine discrimination divine discriminative power to fight the sense mind and its offspring". easy to understand like this. draupadi represents kundalini. when kundalini rises up the spine at each center we have one of the pandavas no sahadeh then knuckle and then arjuna at manipura like that beam at anahata. when kundalini moves up at each center it produces an offspring and this offspring has some characteristics of sound type of sound and light colors of light. so mooladhara produces a particular type of sound and particular type of light colors. similarly swadhisthana each chakra has and these manifestations of lights and sounds they are represented by sons of draupadi because as kundalini raises these become manifest. so these are the the list of warriors that fought for pandavas these are the characteristic spiritual soldiers we have to cultivate to in order to attain self-realization in order to live a life free from pain and suffering and in that perpetual joy we have to have these qualities.

## Universal Principles of Yoga

now you must have observed that although we started studying bhagavad-gita in the process we have found we found correlation with patanjali yoga sutras. now we have seen the need for mnem asana pranayam prachahar dharan dhyan samadhi. what are these patanjali astanga marg the eight steps of patanjalastanga mark so there is perfect correlation there is no contradiction patanjali astanga mark described here in bhagavad-gita. one more thing i would like to mention this is not there it is not here only in hinduism or yoga sutras. yoga is so universal that is the "real esoteric essence of all great religions of the world" esoteric that implied that the kernel of each religion is that yoga union with god. it although it appears that we are talking about hindu hinduism or patanjali yoga sutras familiar here in india no everywhere it is there. for instance sent teresa of avila sent teresa she wrote about the different stages of prayer. she used the word prayer she didn't use the word yoga. different stage of prayer like oral prayer mental prayer prayer of recollection prayer of quiet prayer of communion prayer of union. this is yoga in christian terminology this yoga in christian terminology. look at the faces oral prayer mental prayer prayer recollection prayer of quiet prayer of communion prayer of union. same thing dharana dhyana samadhi union a description of successive stages of prachahara interiorization. in the inner stillness there comes the awareness of god with oneself prayer of communion and then the uniting of one's consciousness with god prayer of union. now the very words after listening to the uh i mean listening to the words like samadhi these words also make sense. oral prayer mental prayer prayer recollection prayer of quiet prayer of communion prayer of union same thing when it's universal words may be different terminology is different but principles are same that's the thing.

## The Loss of Self-Mastery (Abhimanyu)

now just one point before i complete today about abhimanyu. these are the characters pandava various we studied but there one question you know many people have why abhimanyu was killed. abhimunyu is a very sweet sweet devotee sweet warrior and he was a great great warrior having so many skills sweet but he also had to go how why why did it happen? here is some explanation on that fateful day. dronacharya that is habit he wanted to capture yudhisthira alive because once that is done war is over koroas would have won the war. that's why you wanted to capture registered the eldest of the pandavas for that he planned chakra viewha chakraviha means wheel trap in that battlefield purposefully. but wheel trap only arjuna can break it he knows how to break that so arjuna they made a plan arjun was challenged by susharma a warrior who fought on behalf of kauravas he challenged arjun. when he challenged susharma arjun went after him. then Bhagavan Krishna warned him arjuna you should not go here your duty now is to stay back and protect your brother yudhisthira brother registered. then arjuna said no it is the duty of akshatriya to go after someone who challenges him otherwise it's disgraceful for akshatriya i have to do it whatever i am only charity okay let's go. arjun here talking about satri dharma and duty to krishna that too after listening to Gita i mean look at that that influence of maya. you and i our self-control are like that no influence of maya they can any time we may give up. so arjun went after sharma gone. arjun was taken away from the center of the battery field and here we'll trap chakraviha. the only one who knew something about it was abhimanyu. again he knew only to go to break and go into the chakravio but he didn't know how to come out of it he only knew half of it he was hesitating others were hesitating. then pandavas felt that other four pandavas no we'll go behind him and support him let him go first break the will go behind him and help. he went inside pandavas went behind him but they were blocked by jayadratha. jaidratha represents "body bound inclination that attachment to this body". attachment to this body is so powerful that is the that is the one which is sometimes causing me to break the rules of yama niyama pranayama all this i can't do because of my attachment to the body body. so here he blocked so yama nema defeated for one day temporarily. so even you became alone that self-mastery has become alone still he could win oh karna individually duryodhana that is desire greed kracharya individual delusion dustyas and anger. the self-mastery could win one after another one after on the characters but eventually all these characters duryodhan dushyas and karna all of them surrounded him and killed. because self-mastery could win one by one when but all these characters like greed illusion desire you know ripple attachment repulsion all the surrounded self-mastery had to go. i mean it all started self-control losing temporarily temporal you know. arjun was pulled out when someone challenged it may happen with us also. for example i am going on a highway drawing suddenly someone overtakes me suddenly there is some impulse here oh i too can do otherwise he's challenging me and challenging my car no that i should think at that point exercise my self-control. no maybe that's young blood going or maybe in an emergency he had to go quickly. so if i leave him unknown person why should i feel challenged by him do i feel challenged i also drive fast getting into problems. i mean this is this is the self-control losing temporarily. i am very happy with my beautiful colorful 65 inches tv very beautiful i always happy until my neighbor bought 75 inches tv then and that's that's challenging you know sushirama then my tv appears to be small it's not so good until i purchase 85 inches and this is self-control losing self-control rather. and this can happen in our daily life. "the world around us creates desires in us but the world is not responsible for the consequence of the desires" isn't it true? the comparisons sharma all the time all the time it's happening in the world. we we live sometimes for others when you know to please them or to prove that we are better than them like that. so let us exercise that self-control always otherwise that self-mastering us abhimanyu may be killed. once we lose at the menu that means we are not able to enjoy meditation long for longer long periods even after meditation. the benefits of meditation should spill over to our work even when you are not meditating for that self-mastery is required not to lose that not to lose that.

## Conclusion

okay i would like to stop here and we will continue with other slokas 789 in the next class. so just to in one minute to recall today we first noted the great warriors who came to fight on behalf of pandavas because pandavas alone five of them could not have won the war without the help of so many other supporters. similarly in my search for god my little self-control my practice of yama niyama and pranayama calmness are not adequate. these qualities are not adequate i also need the support of many other qualities like devotion, spiritual memory you know dharana dhyana samadhi ecstasy all these things also are required. i have to cultivate them. the solace is that "one need not be born with these divine qualities". this could be cultivated. in fact as guruji said they are the spiritual effects meaning spiritual results of the practice of yoga by devotees that means by you and by me we can we can cultivate them. which eventually help us to win this internal kurukshetra and thereby attain self-realization and lead a smooth and joyous life. 

jai guru.
