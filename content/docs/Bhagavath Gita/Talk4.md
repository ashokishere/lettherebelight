## Winning the Battle of Life (Kurukshetra Within Me)


love and greetings to each one of you from yoga ashrams. welcome to this discourse which is fourth in a series of talks on the wisdom of bhagavad-gita as interpreted by param suvarnanji in his book God Talks with Arjuna. in the first talk yoga nanji clearly pointed out that we lost our divine kingdom in the game of delusion. to regain that divinity a kurukshetra war is going on within each one of us as our good tendencies and bad tendencies oppose each other. siding with good tendencies would lead us to lasting happiness and eventually self-realization.

Let me read guruji's words on this point: "Each person has to fight his own battle of kurukshetra. It is a war not only worth winning but in the divine order of the universe and of the eternal relationship between the soul and God a war that sooner or later must be". that is assurance is giving that this is a war each one of us will win because that is the cosmic design, that is the wish of god, sooner or later, let it be sooner.

Guruji also gives another assurance: "as God talked with Arjuna so will he talk with you as he lifted up the spirit and consciousness of Arjuna so will he uplift you as he granted Arjuna supreme spiritual vision so will he confer enlightenment on you".

## The First Sloka: Life is a Series of Battles

with this background we studied the first loka of the first chapter in Gita. the first sloka tells us a fundamental truth that life is a series of battles between good and evil, knowledge and ignorance, soul and body, self-control and temptation and the like. it's constantly going on.
The advice given to us by Veda Vyasa is that a devotee each night should honestly introspect, like Sanjay was describing what was happening on the battlefield to blind king Dhritarashtra. our introspection should reveal to our mind how our bad tendencies and good tendencies were on that day. we have to introspect each day. it is not that we want to know what we have done, more importantly, we want to know why we did what we did, what is the purpose, what is the motive behind our actions. that is also important if we are to progress spiritually. that is the import of the first loka.

## The Second Sloka: Warning against Material Desire


the second sloka gives us a warning how our past bad habits try to dissipate when we start spiritual practices. thus we find the second verse of the Gita forewarning the spiritual aspirant that king Duryodhana (material desire) will try to arouse man's Dronacharya (sense habit tendencies) to fight against the sole forces of discrimination. an ordinary person knowing nothing about the supreme joy that can come out of meditation innocently reconciles himself to sense pleasures whatever he can get through tongue, eyes, ears—he's happy. but once he starts meditating and he finds that there is so much more in this meditation, then the king material desire inside, which was always depending on the senses for its pleasures, gets alarmed. this fellow is now going towards meditation, that means I would be denied of my joys which I was getting from all these senses all along. so he would turn towards Dronacharya (past habit) to discourage the devotee from meditating.

That's why we find that whenever we sit in meditation, especially in the beginning, we get so many reminders of the unfinished jobs to dissuade us from meditating. thoughts like "oh you have to make a telephone call," or "that incomplete job first, right now finish and then you can meditate peacefully," or "others are waiting for dinner," or "you are tired, tomorrow you can see," come to discourage the person. even those persons with resolute effort who sit for meditation then the past habit of sleepiness, thoughts, all these things also try to dissuade him. so this is the warning given to us: beware, beware, discouragement doesn't necessarily come from outside, others disturbing us; discouragement comes from within most of the time.

## Cultivating Good Habits (Dronacharya's Good Side)

but there is hope because Dronacharya was not only the teacher of Kauravas, he was also the teacher of Pandavas. the habit could be good also; habits do not mean they are always bad, they could be good. so take advantage of the good habits, same Dronacharya, to help us in our pursuit of higher goals. we can somehow cultivate Dronacharya because in the heart of hearts Dronacharya wanted victory to Pandavas although by force of circumstances he had to fight on behalf of Kauravas. so what is Dronacharya in our spiritual practices? regularity habit. that's a good habit, good side of Dronacharya, so form that regular habit. if we form the habit of meditating regularly, then we will win the war; Dronacharya is on our side.

## The Third Sloka: The Role of Intuitive Awakening

next we studied the third sloka. it gives a clue how to win our bad habits. the summary of the sloka is here: "Thus it is explained in this verse that when material desire and his army of sense tendencies and their restless thoughts try to reinforce themselves by past material habit in order to dissipate the spiritual aspirant from the practice of meditation they find that the calm inner light of awakening intuition well trained in meditation by past spiritual habit has effectively arrayed the discriminative faculties to give metaphysical resistance".

ultimately it is that calm inner light of intuitive awakening only can destroy bad habits. intuitive awakening means there is not only the conviction but intuitively it can intuit and see the worthlessness of going ahead with this bad habit in future. it can see the future intuitively that "this is not going to help me" so that conviction has to come inside intuitively, then it can be destroyed.
the calm inner light of intuitive awakening is represented by Drishtadyumna who was the commander in chief of Pandava army and eventually he is the one who killed Dronacharya (the habit). he could kill Dronacharya because intuitive awakening can only get rid of the habits.

How can we develop that intuitive awakening? Drishtadyumna came out of fire after intense tapas done by his father Drupada. similarly, the awakening comes by spiritual practices; when we do regularly meditation, then that awakening gradually gradually comes—that intuitive awakening through which we can destroy our bad habits.

## Slokas Four, Five, and Six: The Need for Allies

then we took the study of slokas four, five, and six in the last talk. these slokas tell us something: Pandavas, five of them alone, could not win the Kurukshetra war; they needed the support of many allies, many supporters were there who helped them to win the war, like Virat, Drupada, Kashiraja, Kunti Bhoja, Purujit, Sebiya—all these kings helped Pandavas to win the war. similarly, my pranayama, my self-control, and calmness are not adequate to win this internal Kurukshetra and find self-realization. I also need help of many other qualities like spiritual memory, discriminative intelligence, devotion—all these qualities are required. these qualities are spiritual effects gathered by a devotee by practice of yoga meditation. one need not necessarily be born with these divine qualities like devotion, spiritual memory, shraddha, discrimination, vairagya (dispassion); not necessarily do they come with birth, we can cultivate them as we are doing sadhana. these qualities come to surface and eventually they come to our aid in fighting this internal kurikshetra.

## Slokas Seven and Eight: Identifying the Kaurava Warriors (Evil Tendencies)

today we'll take up slokas seven and eight. before that let's first listen to the sloka sung by Swami Vasudevanji. the plain meaning of the seventh sloka goes like this as given by Gurudev Paramasuji, Duryodhana continues: "listen to a flower of the twice born best of the brahmins about the generals of my army who are prominent among us ourselves these i speak about now for the information".

Recall that from sloka three to six Duryodhana, having surveyed the army of Pandavas, explained the various warriors standing there to fight on behalf of Pandavas. Guruji has given the explanation: the spiritual soldiers they are in our cerebral spinal centers to help the devotee. after identifying the Pandava warriors, now Duryodhana identifies the Kaurava warriors and names them to his guru Dronacharya.
And 8th sloka: these warriors are thyself, meaning Bhishma, Karna, Krupa, victors in battles, Aswatthama, Vikarna, Somadatta, and Jayadratha. these are the warriors ready to fight for me.

What do they represent? Dronacharya represents habit, Bhishma ego, body bound inclination. these are the eight warriors and these are the inclinations they represent; obviously they're all evil inclinations. they are their inners, these frailties and weaknesses that have become once comfortable second nature. they have become second nature; sometimes we don't even realize because they have become part of our consciousness unfortunately. the first thing is to realize, identify them and try to work them out of our system.

## Correlation with Patanjali Yoga Sutras and the Goal of Sadhana

here there is perfect analogy with Patanjali Yoga Sutras. we have seen that the good tendencies in us perfectly correlate with the tendencies given in Patanjali Yoga Sutras; they correlate very well. here even the negative tendencies are also mentioned in Patanjali Yoga Sutras.

Yoga Sutra 24 in Chapter 1 of Patanjali Yoga Sutras reads like this: Patanjali says "The lord is untouched by klesha meaning trouble, karma action, vipaka habit, ashaya desire". meaning Lord is beyond these qualities—troubles, action, habit and desire—He doesn't have.

In another yoga sutra, Sutra 3 in the second chapter, the klesha (trouble) is defined as fivefold: avidya meaning ignorance, asmita meaning ego, raga attachment, dwisha aversion, avinivesa body attachment. thus here there are eight qualities are mentioned which Lord is untouched by, meaning Lord doesn't have these defects. these imperfections are completely away from God like material action and habit and desire, ignorance, ego, attachment, repulsion—He doesn't have.

What is that we are looking for in our life? self-realization, our lasting happiness, meaning I am God, I am a spark of divinity. if I am divine, I must be having all the qualities of God in me. what are the qualities of God? love, joy, wisdom, compassion, forgiveness. these are the qualities of Lord so all these qualities I must have. similarly God doesn't have certain qualities like ego, habit, desires, attachment, repulsion. these qualities God doesn't have so I also should be free from these imperfections if I were to become God. now ahambramasmi is the fundamental truth, I am divine. if so I must be having this good qualities in me and I must be having none of these bad qualities. but if I honestly look within I have these imperfections in me. I have desire, repulsion, attachment, likes, dislikes, all these I have.
The question is: are you going to get rid of these infections when you become God, or you become God when you get rid of these imperfections? the answer is clear: my sadhana means I have to get rid of these imperfections in me. when these imperfections are out of my system, my consciousness, then I am that close to divinity.

Sadhana means that, as Yoganandaji said in one sentence: "seeking God means expressing God". if I say that I am a devotee, I am seeking God, means I must be expressing God in my daily life. I must be expressing love, joy, forgiveness, compassion, wisdom. at the same time I should not have any imperfections like ego, raga, dwisha, attachment, repulsion, desires. that is what is meant by sadhana.
Remember that seeking God means expressing God. we must live like that, not only for the sake of achieving God's self-realization, but even for lasting happiness. if you have these imperfections—ego, delusion, desires, raga, dwesha—then we can't be happy in life.

## Warrior 1: Krupacharya (Avidya/Individual Delusion)

the first warrior is Krupacharya, who represents avidya meaning individual delusion.
there is some subtle difference between delusion and illusion, which are often used interchangeably. delusion is something universal that affects everyone but illusion is something which affects only particular persons not universal. An example of delusion is "I am this body" because almost everyone thinks that. An example of illusion is if someone has the conviction that it's impossible to live without taking so many cups of coffee every day. Krupacharya represents that illusion, individual delusion.

The Patanjali Yoga Sutras fifth sutra from chapter 2 reads: "Ignorance is perceiving the non-eternal to be eternal impute to be pure evil to be good what is not soul to be the soul". that is avidya. by delusion imagination man creates his own illusions of reality and brings them into being.
Guruji wrote: "thus man is a miniature creator fashioning good or evil for himself and the phenomenon world of which is an operative part. It is this creative force inherent in man's thoughts that makes them so formidable. The truth in the adage thoughts or things should be duly respected".

Guruji goes on saying: "the influence of the force of avidya illusion is such that no matter how ixam the illusion deluded man is loath to part with it". and Guruji goes on saying very nicely: "man fabricates his own standards of morality and behavior and calls them good irrespective of their disharmony with eternal divine love".

We have to conquer him because as long as this individual delusion (avidya) is there, we can't be happy, we can't be anywhere close to self-realization. Krupacharya survived the war, but that doesn't mean individual delusion troubles the realized soul. When self-realization happens, the soul's individuality remains. Soul once it comes out of God it plays many roles incarnation of incarnation but never loses his identity its individuality even after merging with God even after self-realization still that identity is maintained in God in spirit. Kripacharya survived, but he didn't trouble anymore. we have to conquer that individual delusion.

## Warrior 2: Bhishma (Ego/Ahamkara)

next warrior Bhishma, the powerful Bhishma, he stands for ego aham hankar. ego need not be negative. when the soul merely uses the instruments of this body and mind as means to communicate and interact with the world outside, it's not a problem.

Guruji explained the levels of ego:
1. "When identified with grass senses and their objects the i-ness becomes the wisdom destroying physical ego".
2. "When identified with the subtle instruments of perception and knowledge in the astral body the inus becomes a clearer sense of being the astral ego".
3. "When the ins expresses solely through pure intuitive wisdom the instrument of the causal body it becomes the pure discriminating ego the divine ego".

The Hindu scriptures say: "when this I shall die then will I know who am I".

Bhishma was killed by Bhishma. he had that gift of inviting his death whenever he wanted (icha marana). the analogy is that my ego wants self-realization, which means dissolving ego, so eventually my ego wants to destroy the ego consciousness. the physical ego and astral ego have to go, then divine ego survives.
Bhishma had to go because his defect was that he always wanted all his children, both Kauravas and Pandavas, to live in peace. even when he saw Kauravas erring and troubling Pandavas, he kept quiet and did not punish the guilty. This mirrors our inner life: I want God, but I also want Pandavas (good inclinations like meditation, devotion) and Kauravas (laziness, pride, desires) together. It doesn't work. Bhishma had to go. the ego has to be subsided.

## Warrior 3: Karna (Attachment/Raga)

the third warrior Karna, he represents attachment raga. Guruji writes: "Karna signifies the propensity for pursuing material action towards which there is natural attachment because of enjoyment or pleasure derived from it". Karna represents Patanjali's raga, which dwells on pleasure. Raga (attachment) and Dwesha (repulsion, represented by Vikarna) are likes and dislikes.

Karna is the principle that causes man to seek work he is attached to because of the pleasure it gives him, and he justifies that action by proclaiming it to be his duty. Karna sided with Duryodhana because he gave him status, but Karna's overriding desire was to prove that I am superior to Arjuna. his attachment to his own goal was the driving force, not friendship or loyalty to Duryodhana's welfare.

When Krishna failed in his peace mission and revealed Karna's identity as the eldest son of Kunti, Karna refused to join the Pandavas, saying it was his duty to protect Duryodhana. He cried, "Why why creator why did you put me in this position?". He didn't approach his gurus (Parshuram or Vyasa) for advice because he was afraid of counsel that may go against his attachment to his desire to prove superiority over Arjuna. 
This overwhelming attachment to his goal eventually brought his downfall and that of his friend Duryodhan and many others.

## Warrior 4: Vikarna (Repulsion/Dwesha)

next Vikarna represents repulsion dwesha. Guruji wrote: "Vikarna means one who behaves according to his natural tendency in avoiding actions that do not give pleasure that are disagreeable".

Man's ignorance creates the dual opposites of likes and dislikes (ragadvesa). Guruji writes: "He is attached to what he likes and avoids what he dislikes rather than exercising discriminative free choice and following what is truly right and best for him".

A simple example is neglecting essential actions like walking for health because it doesn't give immediate joy or pleasure—that is repulsion. The story of the saint and the graveyard illustrates this: if a person does not have one hour to walk in the graveyard now, he will soon spend all his time there. The saint added, "and all those who are resting there in the graveyard said the same thing when they were alive I don't have the time". We must not allow Vikarna to dominate us.
The world conditions us to have likes and dislikes (Karna/Vikarna). For instance, a person who enjoys a football game merely for the skills, without supporting either denominationally aligned team, is sometimes seen as an atheist because the world expects you to have some like some belonging some dislike you should have it.

## Warrior 5: Jayadratha (Body-Bound Inclination/Abhinivesa)

next Jayadratha represents body bound inclination abhinivesa. Jayadratha represents the subtle tenacity to body attachment, Patanjali's fifth klesha (trouble). Western psychologists call it the force of self-preservation and noted that it is strongest urge in man.
While taking care of the body is permitted, this inclination leads to negative side effects. it expresses itself as fear of death but also gives rise to mortal characteristics contrary to the immortal nature of the true self. These characteristics include selfishness, possessiveness, the storing up of treasures on earth as though this will be his permanent home. Jayadratha was eventually killed by Arjun.
Warrior 6: Somadatta's Son (Material Action/Bhurisrivas)
next, the son of Somadatta, also named Bhurisrivas, represents material action. material action that produces binding effects because it is instigated by egoistic desire must be conquered. Guruji writes: "a material action no which produces binding effects that is to be avoided".
The works of a yogi who is established in self-realization leaves no impressions either good or evil to bind him. Actions should be performed with the thought of God so that they do not bind us. The analogy is given of writing on sand (effects left behind, binding) versus writing on water (effects gone, non-binding).

## Warrior 7: Dronacharya (Habit/Samskara)

next warrior is Dronacharya, he represents habit samskara inner tendency. Patanjali's vipaka. Drona represents samskara—the impressions made on the consciousness by past thoughts and actions which create strong tendencies to repeat themselves. Dronacharya was also a guru of Pandavas; we must remember that habit can also be good.

## Warrior 8: Aswatthama (Latent Desire/Ashaya)

the last warrior mentioned is Aswatthama, who represents asia of patanjali meaning latent desire. Yogananda writes that "that which remains unchanged and doesn't perish with death is desire". More specifically, it is latent desire or desired seed (vasana).

Latent desire (Aswatthama) should be distinguished from active desire (Duryodhana). Active desire is an impulse of the mind that produces an independent wish, and can be checked or suppressed by a quick act of will and wisdom. However, every unfulfilled active desire, unless roasted by wisdom, plants a new desired seed in the mind. These desire seeds are more compelling than the impulsive fresh desires deeply rooting themselves in the subconscious ready to spring up suddenly with demands that are most often unreasonable frustrating and sorrow producing.

Latent desire is frustrating because it springs up suddenly without cause, is compelling, and neither control nor fulfillment is possible. Aswatthama survived the war. The key is to roast that latent desire by wisdom. The example of the boy desiring a toy car shows how wisdom eventually destroyed that latent desire and it no longer bothered him.

Aswatthama did not die, but after committing the terrible act of killing the sons of Draupadi, Krishna made him powerless and allowed him to roam around powerless and friendless all alone. similarly the latent desire may be there inside me but that won't bother me when I roast it, when I make it powerless by my wisdom.

### Summary of Evil Tendencies

The warriors described in slokas seven and eight (later in nine also) are the evil tendencies ready to help material desire (Duryodhana).
These are:
1. Krupacharya (individual delusion/illusion/avidya).
2. Bhishma (ego).
3. Karna (raga/like/attachment).
4. Vikarna (dwesha/repulsion/dislike).
5. Son of Somadatta (material action).
6. Jayadratha (body-bound inclination/abhinivesa).
7. Dronacharya (habit/samskara).
8. Aswatthama (latent desire/ashaya).
We must identify them, throw them out, and win.
