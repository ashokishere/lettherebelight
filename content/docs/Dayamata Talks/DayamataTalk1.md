### Opening Prayer and Welcome

Takes a little time. I'm coming. Oh, I’m so high up here! Thank you, my dears. So nice to — I told you last year I’d be here. Well, it’s so wonderful to greet all of you again one year later. Let us just pray for a moment: 

{{< callout type="important" icon="sparkles" >}}

  Heavenly Father, Mother, Friend, Beloved God, Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna, Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, and you, my revered Gurudeva, Paramahansa Yogananda, saints of all religions, we bow to you all. O Divine Mother, mold Thou my life according to Thy will. Bless me that wherever I go, I may spread Thy light, of love, compassion, understanding, forgiveness. Bless us, Lord. We bow to Thee. Aum. Shanti. Shanti. Amen.

{{< /callout >}}



Be seated. Well, you all know me pretty well now, and I’m quite relaxed, coming before you. I do want to spend a few moments expressing our deep appreciation to all of you who have come, and attend these. Someone said, I think it was Brother Achalananda said that it was, he was so — what did he say? It was a privilege for you to come and hear me? Well, it is a privilege for me to come and see all of you. And I’m very grateful; I look forward to this every year. Because it’s been the greatest sense of satisfaction to me, to come together with real divine friends. And I think of all of you as those friends — friends in God, friends in Guruji’s teachings. Friendship, and our trust and faith and love in one another.

### The Genesis of 'Autobiography of a Yogi'

This is the 50th anniversary of the writing of Guruji’s “Autobiography”. My mind travels back to 1931, and Guruji had given me the assignment of typing some of his manuscripts. And I found, in the desk in his study, one chapter, the very first chapter that I was aware of, or that he had written, which is now in the “Autobiography of a Yogi”. Do you know what it was? “The Tiger Swami”. I remember thinking — I didn’t know at that time he was going to be writing a book — I remember thinking, “‘The Tiger Swami’, who could that be?” Well, we sure learned. And it’s a great story. And there’s a lot of truth in it, because one learns by strong mind, by fearlessness, by faith in God, we can conquer any tiger that threatens us in this world. And I mean the tiger of struggle, the tiger of temptation.

That was the first chapter that we were aware of. And of course when Guruji went to India in 1935–36 he quietly gathered a lot of information to place in that “Autobiography”. And our good brother was privileged to travel with him to India. Is it all right if I move that away? It’s a noisy thing, isn’t it? Don’t mind me; I’m just being myself. But if it’s, if you can’t hear me, say so. But other than that, I’ll push it away a little. And so, while he was in India, he collected the various subjects and visited the many saints, not only in India but in Europe, and those were part of his experience, which he placed in that book.
And, of course, Daya Ma had the privilege in the early years in Encinitas, with my sister Ananda Mata, of typing that manuscript. And I can remember the thrill, the excitement! You know, we never heard anything like it, never read anything like it. And when I read all of the metaphysical truths contained in it: the law of karma, the principles by which we live, and all of the knots of confusion which enter into most religions, that he untied; and made it possible for us to understand, in simple language, these immortal truths that have to do with our existence and our relationship with God. And I remember I wrote in my diary at that time, “This book will reach millions”. Now I’m not predicting; Master said later the same thing. But I was so thrilled at the revelations that I found in that book. And as it was my custom, I wrote in my little diary — I had been working with Guruji on this book, not editing, just humble, meager typing. But I could see that it was going to change the lives of many.

### The Living Power of Kriya Yoga

And you, you dear ones, you have proven that statement of Guruji’s. Because all of you here, I am sure, have greatly benefited, been greatly inspired, by that wonderful book which is now in so many, many languages. And this, of course, is the 50th anniversary of the printing of that book. And I am happy to be here for this 50th. I won’t promise anything more than that. So, one devotee said about the “Autobiography,” 
{{< callout type="important" icon="sparkles" >}}
“It is not a book. It is a living power”.
{{< /callout >}}
Such effect it has had on seekers of God, and seekers of truth, all over this world, in every nation.

I thought, “What can I say to these dear souls tonight?” You’ve heard many, many talks. And you are about now to go back to your homes. You’ve received the Kriya diksha, which is a very sacred initiation. And I urge you all to practice it faithfully. I remember Guruji’s words to me many years ago: “If you practice nothing but Kriya, you will reach there”. And I believe it. And I have found to my own complete satisfaction that all of those statements, those utterances of truth which Master made throughout those years have come to pass in my own life.

### Seeking God First: The Common Denominator

Each one of you here have come. Sorry! Okay. They’re great, aren’t they? They know what to do. Each one of you who came here tonight, came, each one of you, with a different need, with a particular need. You know what that need is; you know what brought you here. And if we think of that, then we have here at least 37-odd hundred needs gathered together in this audience. Each one of you knows what that need is. But let me say this to you. I always remembered throughout my life as a young monastic on the path words uttered in the scripture — Christian scripture, 

{{< callout icon="sparkles" >}}
 “Seek ye the kingdom of God first, and all these things will be added unto you”.
{{< /callout >}}

And my nature is to reduce everything to a common denominator. For me, the common denominator of all life’s needs, all life’s experiences, all life’s desires is one: God alone. And to my own complete satisfaction, it has been a great blessing that I have found that all those needs, all those little desires that I might have had, everything that I might have craved in this world — Ah! I have found, my dears, that fulfillment in God, to my complete satisfaction. And how often when I go to meditate in the evening, because I like to be true to myself: “Is there anything in this universe you want? Is there anything you want?” What can I say? Nothing. There is nothing in this world that I crave. I crave love, I crave friendship. But I’ve found that by giving, it has come back to me a thousand-fold. And I pray in the same way, that seeking God and putting God first will fill your own lives. And you will find that all of those needs that brought you here, will find complete fulfillment in that one Cosmic Beloved: our God.

### Balancing Modern Life with Spiritual Truths

Master wrote — and I was reading it just this evening before I came down — Master wrote to a member, “I am a follower of the 'Bhagavad Gita,' which points out the path for this modern age, teaching us to learn how to be in this world but not of it”. I like that, because that is the message that’s needed today. We have become so much caught up in Internet — what’s that other word for it, computers? That’s all I read about is Internet, Internet. “Have you got a page on the Internet?” And so this, we’re, our minds are just going outward. We’re no longer couch potatoes at the TV set, we’re couch potatoes at the Internet. Everybody’s got one; I don’t. And so, this age is an age of automation — everything is becoming automatic. We only have to sit and just snap our fingers and we can turn on a light, or snap our fingers and something happens. I don’t know what, but something happens!
Anyway, you know what I’m talking about, don’t you? And so, what’s happening, my dears, is that all of these things, while we think they are saving us time, they’re encroaching upon our lives. They’re taking our time away from us. They’re not allowing us time for God. They’re not allowing us time for quiet contemplation, for thinking, for feeling. And I’m not referring to emotionalism — for feeling. What is life all about? What is God all about? What is truth? These are the principles that we need to be thinking about: What can we do constructively to help this world? Look at the mess it’s in today. Look at the tragic things that are happening around the world. Why? Man is a bundle of nerves, of anger, of fear, of hatred, of greed. You cannot deny it. Why? Because we’ve become so immersed in the world. And everything we get gives us one more thing to be involved in this world, so that there’s no time, no time to say, “What am I? Who am I? Where am I going?"

### Seeking God in Youth and the Prayer Circle

"I’m young. I’m full of energy.” But there comes a day when you begin to look like Daya Ma. Then what happens to you? Then what happens? Make time now, my dears. Guruji used to say, “In the youth of life, reap the richest harvest of Self-realization, so that in the twilight of life you may know He is with you”. That’s a beautiful message, one that we all need to remember. And so, in your coming here to these annual Convocations, you come because you are thirsty; you come because you are looking for some inspiration, some help, some blessing. And we want you to go away knowing that here, in Mother Center, and among all these devotees, you have that family. You have those who care for you. We may not be able to reach out and touch every one of you individually, but you know this for certain: that no day passes in the life of Daya Ma or any of these devotees, but what there is a deep, deep engagement with God, praying for every one of you. My little altar is high with prayer requests. Master’s Shrine is high with prayer requests.

And we are very faithful to that ideal which Master started many years ago, the Worldwide Prayer Circle. And you all have a responsibility to be a part of it. That is your responsibility. The world has become dark with evil. And I don’t like to dwell on that, because I really don’t believe in accepting. But look around you and you will find there are many problems in this world, in every nation. It needs help. The poor Lord is crying for somebody: “Help Me, help Me”. He needs us. Everybody’s going toward darkness — because of greed, because of personal desires, personal aims. Let’s get busy joining those who are seeking and trying to serve God to the world. Not so much through words, my dears, but through our example, through how we behave in this world.

### Personal Lessons from Paramahansa Yogananda

In this talk Master said, “The purpose of this teaching is to help mankind become firmly established in his eternal nature as a child of God”. This simply means, my dears, that the teaching of the Bhagavad Gita, which all of you now have, or most of you have, and if you haven’t, please get it. That’s supposed to be a little commercial thing — just a little. I have to tell you something. These are just little stories that come to mind that I dwell. What Master spoke in Los Angeles at the Trinity Auditorium, and I was extremely shy. You wouldn’t know me if you saw me then and now. I was shy. And Master called me to him one day. And we were — a group of us were going down to serve in his lecture. He spoke at — it was at Trinity Auditorium here in those days. I don’t know whether it’s still here.

And I believe Ananda Mata, myself, brother Dick, and some of the others were going down to help with this. As Master was driving down in the car with us he says, “Faye, I want you to speak tonight”. I never opened my mouth before anybody in my life! And I said, “Master, I can’t say anything!” He says, “It’s all right”. He said, “I’m going to tell them about your healing,” because I was immediately healed in Salt Lake when I first met him. And he said, “I’ll just call you, and you just come and say a few words”. I was shaking, really shaking. Now that was the beginning of my getting involved with the public. I’m sure that while I was speaking I turned my back to the audience so they wouldn’t see me. But I got through it. And that was the beginning of Daya Ma’s making some effort to speak before the public. I said to him later, “Master, I can’t talk. There’s nothing.” You know what he said? And I say this to all of you, monks, nuns, and devotees who serve: “Just be sincere”. I never forgot those words. Don’t be anything more than you are, just be sincere. People will feel that. And that is a great, great truth to remember.

### The Middle Path and Practical Calmness

To come back to the subject: The Gita’s purpose is to teach us how to be in the world and not of it. It is a balanced middle path. Some leave the world and join monasteries and seek God only. Others become so worldly that they don’t even want to think about God. Now the Gita says, “No, there’s a middle path: Learn how to be in the world but not of it”. We have our duties, you have your duties, you’re going back to your homes, you have all your responsibilities. You assume those when you go back to your homes. But on the other side, don’t be enmeshed in the world. How do you avoid that? Carry on your responsibilities, yes. But keep your mind a little bit withdrawn. Now, I don’t mean withdrawn from your husbands or wives and children. I mean don’t become so immersed in all of the things that happen to you. That is not easy. But the way it becomes easy, when you learn to include God in your daily life. He becomes your sustainer. He becomes your support. He becomes the One that upholds you and reminds you that “This is not my world. My world is with You, my God”.

We need to remember that. Gita is a perfect scripture for that kind of understanding. And I would urge you all to follow it, to read it; it’s very deep. I’m still reading the introduction. Well, I’ve read more than that, but — oh, it’s so nice to laugh with all of you. This is what God is all about. When I first came I thought one should be, well, you should be around, very solemn and oh, you know, hold your hands in front of you like this, and keep your head bowed and — not sincere. Master said, “Why are you?” — he turned to my Mother and said, “Is she always like this?” I remember my mother saying, “No, she was always, she was such a happy, cheerful child”. Is that funny? And so, he said to me, 

{{< callout type="important" >}} 
  “Seeking God,” as his guru said to him, “is the funeral of all sorrow”.
{{< /callout >}}

 And he wrote something to me that said, that I shall always remember, “You should always be cheerful, for that is your nature”. With those thoughts, and he had the power — and you have the same when you read these things — he had the power to go deep into your consciousness and impinge that thought on your mind. And with those words, I knew exactly what I should be doing: Get rid of this shyness. Get rid of this unnatural. Be yourself. Be sincere. Be kind. God expects that of you. Be loving; be just. Try to be understanding and compassionate. Want nothing. Be satisfied with what God gives you. And then you will find that He fills your plate, heaping. Such is His grace.

### Guidelines for Daily Living

You know something? Many years ago, and some of these may help you, because they’re very simple, simple thoughts. How to overcome tensions, and fears, and all of these emotions that strike at us. When we were around Master, he insisted that we learn to work calmly. And some of us have the nature of getting things done fast. So I went back to my room and said, "One of the things you have to learn is to think one thought at a time". We have a tendency to rush in and think so many thoughts that we end up being extremely nervous. So I made that one of the points that I would concentrate on. Think one thought at time. Don’t let thoughts crowd in on you, so that you are not able to think clearly at all. And what helps me with that is the Hong-Sau Technique — a powerful technique for developing the art of concentration. And another one we all need to learn: Don’t interrupt while others are talking. Listen. Learn to be a good listener in this world.

And the other one, Guruji often said, 

{{< callout type="important" >}} 
"Learn to read good books. Don't read trash. Don't waste your time. Read books that require your concentration, that inspire you, that uplift you. But, of course, read mine first".
{{< /callout >}}

 And I did. And the next one is: Don't eat so fast. You know, these are simple things. Eat your food slowly. "And exercise regularly," said Master. "Strive to keep your weight down". That's an important one. And then he said, "Relax. Don't rush about or get bogged down in little things. Learn to relax more". That's a wonderful thing to do. Let's all sit back and relax. Just relax a little. Yeah sometimes you'd be amazed at how uptight you are. I do that throughout the day; just let go, relax. So you can think more. When you're tensed, you're burning up energy, burning up the nerves. So those are helpful points, aren't they?
The next is: Learn to appreciate whatever you do. Sometimes devotees will say, "I have no self-esteem". Why? You're a child of God; He loves you. You're as important to Him as any child who reached Him as a saint. You are His. You have value. You must learn to value yourselves. So learn to appreciate whatever you do.

## Finding Value and Seclusion
And the next, Guruji said,
{{< callout type="important" >}} 
"Set aside time for seclusion when you can just be alone with God".
{{< /callout >}}

Wonderful, wonderful. Find time. It might even be, maybe just in a little corner of your home. It might be out on the grounds. It's nice when you can come for a retreat with us. But have time when you can be alone. Everyone needs, what they say today, their own "space"? I tried to think what that meant. How much space does each person need? Anyway those are the words I hear today. So whatever your space is, take it. Well, these are all Master's ideas.

And the next, and this he said again and again. How often he used to touch us or point here, and he said, 

{{< callout type="important" >}} 
"Just keep your mind here all the time. Let your mind always rest here in God". When you practice meditation, when you're doing your Techniques, meditation, — Aum Technique, Hong-Sau — your mind is always — you’re training yourself to gradually just bring your attention to this point.
{{< /callout >}}

 And throughout the day keep your mind there. When you're not doing something let your mind rest here. This is the center of the third eye. This is the center of concentration. It is wonderful to live that way. I’m so grateful, because my mind is always here in this center. It becomes habit after awhile. And when that happens you find you're always focused. You're always centered. You're not scattered. And finally, the last one, which I love: try always to follow in the Master's footsteps. And let his will be done with the work. And those are the principles that we need to live by. Those have been my private guidelines through all these many years, a great blessing.

### A Final Call to Love and Self-Realisation

Well, dear ones, it's been wonderful to be with all of you again, and to laugh with you, to enjoy friendship with you, to reciprocate all of the love, and the goodwill, and the friendship, which you give to us. Our hearts are united in one common bond: God first, God above all else. We all have our little duties in this world. It is as it should be. Let us do them to the best of our ability. But let us keep our minds always centered in Him, for He is the one common bond, the one common, unbroken thread that unites all of our hearts, all of His children around the universe. Let's get over these notions of color, creed, and nationality. It’s nonsense. It has nothing to do with seeking God. Let us try to understand one another.
But let us always be fearless when we must uphold truth. I believe in that. Fearless, in the sense that we pray for those who do not understand us; fearless, in the sense that we believe in the power of God, that even when someone hurts us, pray for them. We cannot expect that the world will love us. That has nothing to do with us. But we have much that we must expect of ourselves: love, forgiveness, understanding, compassion. That's our role in this world.

And so, as you go back to your homes, carry these thoughts of Guruji with you. Take your Lessons and don't just set them aside, as Master would say. Every day, as an example, I pick up, before I go into my study, to take on the duties of Master's work, and I read some thought from that. And then I say, "This is my lesson for today. This I will try to put into effect this day." And I find it gives me tremendous strength. And I find, "Oh, that's the way one learns". When you take a truth and you begin to use it, apply it. Not just say, "It’s wonderful and I've heard it". No, you must use it. Make it part of, we must make it part of our lives. Then we change. Then we gradually develop that Self-realization, which is the purpose for which every one of us have come here, in spite of all our different needs. Our ultimate need is Self-realization, knowing that we are gods, and that the spirit of God dwelleth within every one of us, without exception.

### Closing Prayer and Farewell

So, God bless you all, my dears. Can we meditate a few minutes? Let us all pray together: 

{{< callout icon="sparkles" >}}
 Heavenly Father, Mother, Friend, Beloved God, Jesus Christ, Bhagavan Krishna, Mahavatar Babaji, Lahiri Mahasaya, Swami Sri Yukteswarji, and you, my beloved Gurudeva, Paramahansa Yogananda, saints of all religions, I bow to You all. O Divine Mother, mold Thou my life, according to Thy design, and bless me, that I may never lose sight of Thee. 
 
 Help me, that I may learn, to carry on my duties faithfully, lovingly, and cheerfully, while at the same time knowing that You are the power behind all my thoughts, behind the throb of my heart, behind this breath of mine. For Thou art my Life, Thou art my Love, Thou art the Ultimate Goal, which all of us, are seeking. Bless us, Lord. We are Thine.
 
May Thy love shine forever, on the altar of my devotion, and may I be able to awaken Thy love in all hearts. 

Aum. Shanti. Shanti. Amen.
{{< /callout >}}


Well, God bless you, my dears. God bless you. I wish it were possible to take the hand of every one of you. But in my heart and in my mind I clasp each one of you as friends. I was born with one wish. And I told that to Master many years ago. “Master, I haven’t any desires. If there’s one, it’s real friends.” Look. Look, nothing more to want. God bless you all. And you have all of mine. God bless you, God bless. Be happy, be cheerful. Jai Guru, Jai Guru to all of you. Jai Guru! Jai Guru!
